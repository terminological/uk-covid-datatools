<!-- # Abstract -->

<!-- NHS 111 data provides a different perspective from traditional data sources, in that it reflects activity in a different subgroup of the population. It is produced as a by producet of the telephone consultation and collected by automated systems, so has fewer issues in terms of data quality and timeliness. It does however have a different set of limitations in that it may be influenced by internal policy and external behaviour and the observation maybe non specific. It is however, showing strong signals in specific age groups, particularly the young, which support the argument that the outbreak is accelerating.  -->



<!-- # Methods -->

## Data

* The data are Covid-19 specific extracts of NHS 111 telephony records for England obtained from NHS Pathways which are updated on a daily basis.
* The data contains, among others, geography and age of the patient. 
* The patient geography/location has been defined by Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and aggregated to NHS region using Office for National Statistics (ONS) published lookups [@ClinicalCommissioningGroup; @ClinicalCommissioningGroupa]. 
* Patient age is assigned to one of the following age groups: <1, 1-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years old, where an age is not listed the age is assigned as unknown. 
* Disposition codes and descriptors are assigned by NHS Pathways [@StatisticsIntegratedUrgent]. 
* We assume that all records pertaining to Covid-19 disposition codes are reported in the daily extract, and that all reporting centres report each day.
* Outcome is classified as either "self care", "clinical review" (within 4-12 hours), "urgent clinical review" (within 2 hours), or needing an "emergency ambulance". -->
* This is a count of number of assessments, not the number of people. 
* Users may have accessed the service multiple times with different symptoms. 
* NHS Pathways data is sourced from a live system that is updated every 15 minutes. 
* The data is extracted for the dashboard and open data files with as little delay as possible but there can be a time delay between the extraction processes meaning that the dashboard and open data files may have different totals.

<!-- The data is provided via NHS. The data are Covid-19 specific extracts of NHS 111 telephony records for England obtained from NHS Pathways which are updated on a daily basis.

<!-- The includes information on people who contacted the emergency services via different routes, i.e. the NHS 111 website, or phoned 111 or 999. Where the contact concerned symptoms and signs of COVID-19 outcome is recorded and this was classified as either "self care", "clinical review" (within 4-12 hours), "urgent clinical review" (within 2 hours), or needing an "emergency ambulance". -->

<!-- The 111 data reports the triages which have received a potential coronavirus (COVID-19) final disposition, from 18 March 2020. This is a count of number of assessments, not the number of people. This data is based on signs and symptoms reported by members of the public through these channels, and is not based on the outcomes of tests for coronavirus. Members of the public may have accessed the service multiple times with different symptoms. NHS Pathways data is sourced from a live system that is updated every 15 minutes. The data is extracted for the dashboard and open data files with as little delay as possible but there can be a time delay between the extraction processes meaning that the dashboard and open data files may have different totals. -->

## Analysis

* $R_t$ values are calculated using the Cori method, and the R library EpiEstim assuming the serial interval follows a `r dpc$serial$printSerialInterval()`.
* Incidence figures a smoothed using a locally fitted polynomial spline of degree 2 fitted to the logarithm of incident observations
* Growth rates are calculated as the gradient of that spline.

<!-- ## England overview -->

<!-- `r ref$fig("111-CTRY")` shows numbers of contact events by outcome where self care expected to be mild cases, clinical review moderate or severe, and emergency ambulance for life threatening. Whole time series of incidence (on log scale) from lock down to present including $R_t$ and growth rates. -->

<!-- Panel A: -->

<!-- * Anomaly in self care centred around VE day due to changes in internal policy and categorization. No further changes in policy known. -->
<!-- * Initial decrease followed by stable $R_t$ during lock down  -->
<!-- * Self care cases seen to start rising in late July, with rate of increase accelerating. -->
<!-- * More recently followed by increases in other outcomes including ambulance calls for COVID. -->
<!-- * ambulance rates dropped back but this could be reporting artefact -->

<!-- Panel B: -->

<!-- * $R_t$ significantly above one on self care metric and may have been as high as 1.7 at times.  -->
<!-- * Other measures also now significantly above 1. -->

<!-- Panel C: -->

<!-- * Growth rates positive and increasing since end of August. -->

## 111 volumes by Region and Outcome

<!-- * In `r ref$fig("111-NHSER")` we see rates of 111 calls on a log scale.  -->

<!-- * Latterly large increases in London and South West. Upward trend in other outcomes.  -->
<!-- * In `r ref$fig("111-NHSER-GROWTH")` we see associated growth rates.  -->
<!-- * Notably growth in call volumes resulting in a self-care outcome has been positive for a long time in certain regions - e.g. North West, London.  -->
<!-- * The other, more serious, outcomes entering positive growth around 24th - 31st August. -->
<!-- * `r ref$tab("111-NHSER-Doubling")` shows doubling times of these metrics, with self care cases anticipated to be doubling every week. The more serious outcomes growing more slowly. -->

Notable inflections in the incidence curves for 5-14 age group around the beginning of August, in calls with self care outcomes,  which has been rising exponentially since. -->

## Discussion

* Using $R_t$ calculated from 111 & 999 call data, which result in an urgent clinical review, or for which an ambulance attends is basis of our triage model estimate which we have been submitting to date.
* The other outcomes of self care and clinical review are showing a differet picture of growth.
* This may be influenced by behavioral factors, but also possibly reflects a younger community based population that is mildly symptomatic.

## Limitations & next steps

* No equivalent outcome data for Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland.
* A weekly behavioral artifact is noted with more calls on a Monday Tuesday and fewer over weekend.
* Large behavioral element possible - not clear that self care could be a default option for people that are not thought to have COVID. A clearer understanding of the COVID pathway is needed.
* Confounding due to other respiratory symptoms - seasonal asthma, RSV, etc.
* Outcome does not include information about whether self isolation / testing is recommended. Need further discussion with 111 & 999 providers.

<!-- # Conclusion -->

<!-- * Exponential growth is significantly higher than submitted estimates when using looser definitions of cases that may include mild cases in the community. -->
<!-- * Current hospital based estimates do not reflect focus of spread in community and younger people. -->
<!-- * These findings should be cross referenced to admissions. -->
