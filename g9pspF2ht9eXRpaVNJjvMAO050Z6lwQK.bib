Aims To measure the effect of depression on mortality after controlling for cognitive decline, cardiovascular risk factors and antidepressant use. Method A prospective cohort study derived from data from a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of moderate hypertension. A total of 2584 participants, aged 65-75 years at study entry, were followed up for 11 years. Results Depression on the SelfCARE—D scale was associated with mortality after controlling for gender. After controlling for cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive decline and antidepressant use, depression continued to have a modest effect (hazard ratio=1.43; 95\% C11.03-1.98). Depression in males and in people aged under 70 years significantly increased the risk of death. Conclusions Depression was associated with mortality only after controlling for gender. There was a modest but robust association between depression and mortality that was not explained by confounding by cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive decline or history of antidepressant use.},

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Wave II Study (DMMS) patients who started dialysis in 1996, and were followed until October 31 2001. Cox regression analysis was used to model adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) for mortality for categories of body mass index (BMI), both as quartiles and as {$>$} or =30 kg/m2 vs. lower. Because such a large proportion of peritoneal dialysis patients changed to hemodialysis during the study period (45.5\%), a sensitivity analysis was performed calculating survival time both censoring and not censoring on the date of change from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. RESULTS: There were 1675 hemodialysis and 1662 peritoneal dialysis patients. Among hemodialysis patients, 5-year survival for patients with BMI {$>$} or =30 kg/m2 was 39.8\% vs. 32.3\% for lower BMI (P {$<$} 0.01 by log-rank test). Among peritoneal dialysis patients, 5-year survival for patients with BMI {$>$}/=30 kg/m2 was 38.7\% vs. 40.4\% for lower BMI (P {$>$} 0.05 by log-rank test). In adjusted analysis, BMI {$>$} or = 30 kg/m2 was associated with improved survival in hemodialysis patients (AHR 0.89; 95\% CI 0.81, 0.99; P= 0.042) but not peritoneal dialysis patients (AHR = 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.86, 1.15; P= 0.89). Results were not different on censoring of change from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that any survival advantage associated with obesity among chronic dialysis patients is significantly less likely for peritoneal dialysis patients, compared to hemodialysis patients.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Binge drinking or heavy episodic drinking is increasingly prevalent, but the health effects are incompletely understood. We investigated whether binge drinking increases the risk for liver disease above and beyond the risk due to average alcohol consumption. Methods 6366 subjects without baseline liver disease who participated in the Finnish population-based Health 2000 Study (2000-2001), a nationally representative cohort. Follow-up data from national registers until 2013 were analysed for liver-related admissions, mortality and liver cancer. Binge drinking (≥5 drinks per occasion, standard drink 12 g ethanol) was categorised as weekly, monthly, or as less often or none. Multiple confounders were considered. Results Eighty-four subjects developed decompensated liver disease. Binge drinking frequency showed a direct association with liver-disease risk after adjustment for average daily alcohol intake and age. After adjustment, the hazard ratios (HRs) for weekly and monthly binge drinking were 3.45 (P=.001) and 2.26 (P=.007) and were higher after excluding regular heavy drinkers. The HR for weekly binging was 6.82 (P=.02) in women; 2.34 (P=.03) in men; and 4.29 (P=.001) in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Weekly binge drinking and the metabolic syndrome produced supra-additive increases in the risk of decompensated liver disease. Weekly, and to a lesser extent monthly, binging retained significance in sequential multivariate models that additionally adjusted for beverage preference and lifestyle, metabolic, and socioeconomic factors. Conclusions Binge drinking is associated with an increased risk for liver disease independently of average alcohol intake and confounders. The rising prevalence of binge drinking and the metabolic syndrome is particularly concerning.},

  abstract = {Dramatic improvement in first-year outcomes post-liver transplantation (LT) has shifted attention to long-term survival, where efforts are now needed to achieve improvement. Understanding the causes of premature death is a prerequisite for improving long-term outcome. Overall and cause-specific mortality of 3,299 Nordic LT patients (1985-2009) having survived 1 year post-LT were divided by expected rates in the general population, adjusted for age, sex, calendar date, and country to yield standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Data came from the Nordic Liver-Transplant Registry and WHO mortality-indicator database. Stagnant patient survival rates {$>$}1 year post-LT were 21\% lower at 10 years than expected survival for the general population. Overall SMR for death before age 75 (premature mortality) was 5.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 5.4-6.3), with improvement from 1985-1999 to 2000-2010 in hepatitis C (HCV) (SMR change 23.1-9.2), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (SMR 38.4-18.8), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (SMR 11.0-4.2), and deterioration in alcoholic liver disease (8.3-24.0) and acute liver failure (ALF) (5.9-7.6). SMRs for cancer and liver disease (recurrent or transplant-unrelated disease) were elevated in all indications except primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Absolute mortality rates underestimated the elevated premature mortality from infections (SMR 22-693) and kidney disease (SMR 13-45) across all indications, and from suicide in HCV and ALF. SMR for cardiovascular disease was significant only in PBC and alcoholic liver disease, owing to high mortality in the general population. Transplant-specific events caused 16\% of deaths. Conclusion: standardized premature mortality provided an improved picture of long-term post-LT outcome, showing improvement over time in some indications, not revealed by overall absolute mortality rates. Causes with high premature mortality (infections, cancer, kidney and liver disease, and suicide) merit increased attention in clinical patient follow-up and future research.

  abstract = {Liver transplantation (LT) is an established therapy associated with a dramatic improvement in patients' life expectancy. With improved early-term management, current 10-year patient survival rates in many indications exceed 70\%. Life-long immunosuppressive therapy may, however, be accompanied by considerable long-term toxicity: most importantly, renal dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, which, in addition to recurrence of the primary liver disease, emerge as key contributors to late mortality. Chronic kidney disease cumulatively affects up to 28\% of patients by ten years after LT. Various factors can contribute to renal impairment, but perioperative acute kidney injury, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, hypertension, and diabetes are considered most important. LT patients demonstrate 3-fold risk for cardiovascular events, which seems to result mostly from an excess of traditional risk factors, mainly hypertension and diabetes. The cumulative cancer incidence reaches 16–42\% by 20 years after LT, and cancer rates are 2- to 4-fold higher among LT patients than among matched controls. Highest rates are for nonmelanoma skin cancer (3- to 70-fold) and lymphoma (8- to 29-fold). The liver graft usually displays uncomplicated function in the long term. Most common causes for chronic graft dysfunction include disease recurrence and biliary problems. LT generally restores patients' quality of life to a level comparable with that of the general population, with only minor deficits in some areas. Thus, long-term survival after LT is impressive, and despite these long-term complications, patients' quality of life remains comparable with that of the general population.},

  abstract = {Objectives Traditionally we have relied mainly on final FIGO stage to estimate overall oncologic outcome in endometrial cancer patients. However, it is well known that other patient factors may play equally important roles in outcome. Our objective was to develop a clinically useful nomogram in the hope of providing a more individualized and accurate estimation of overall survival (OS) following primary therapy. Methods Using a prospectively maintained endometrial cancer database, 1735 patients treated between 1993–2008 were analyzed. Clinical characteristics commonly known to predict OS were collected. For each patient, points were assigned to each of these 5 variables and a total score was calculated. The corresponding 3- and 5-year OS probabilities were then determined from the nomogram. Results The median age was 62 years (range, 25–96). Final grade included: G1 (471), G2 (622), G3 (634), missing (8). Stage included: IA (501), IB (590), IC (141), IIA (36), IIB (75), IIIA (116), IIIB (6), IIIC (135), IVA (7), and IVB (128). Histology included: adenocarcinoma (1376), carcinosarcoma (100), clear cell (62), serous (197). Median follow-up for survivors was 29.2 months (0–162.2 months). Concordance probability estimator for the nomogram is 0.746 ± 0.011. Conclusion Using a large endometrial cancer database we developed a nomogram based on 5 easily available clinical characteristics to predict OS with a high concordance probability. This nomogram incorporates other important individualized patient variables beyond FIGO stage to more accurately predict outcome. This new tool may be useful to clinicians in assessing patients risk when deciding on adjuvant treatment and follow-up.},

We sought to determine survival and liver-related morbidity among community-based NAFLD patients. \emph{Methods:} Four hundred twenty patients diagnosed with NAFLD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 1980 and 2000 were identified using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Medical records were reviewed to confirm diagnosis and determine outcomes up to 2003. Overall survival was compared with the general Minnesota population of the same age and sex. \emph{Results:} Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 49 (15) years; 231 (49\%) were male. Mean follow-up was 7.6 (4.0) years (range, 0.1–23.5) culminating in 3192 person-years follow-up. Overall, 53 of 420 (12.6\%) patients died. Survival was lower than the expected survival for the general population (standardized mortality ratio, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.003–1.76; \emph{P} = .03). Higher mortality was associated with age (hazard ratio per decade, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.7–2.7), impaired fasting glucose (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95\% CI, 1.3–5.2), and cirrhosis (hazard ratio, 3.1, 95\% CI, 1.2–7.8). Liver disease was the third leading cause of death (as compared with the thirteenth leading cause of death in the general Minnesota population), occurring in 7 (1.7\%) subjects. Twenty-one (5\%) patients were diagnosed with cirrhosis, and 13 (3.1\%) developed liver-related complications, including 1 requiring transplantation and 2 developing hepatocellular carcinoma. \emph{Conclusions:} Mortality among community-diagnosed NAFLD patients is higher than the general population and is associated with older age, impaired fasting glucose, and cirrhosis.

Design Two retrospective cohort studies. Setting General practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network, 1 January 2000 to 15 May 2016. Participants Adults aged 18 years or more with no previous stroke or TIA: 11 159 with resolved atrial fibrillation, 15 059 controls with atrial fibrillation, and 22 266 controls without atrial fibrillation. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was incidence of stroke or TIA. Secondary outcome was all cause mortality. Results Adjusted incidence rate ratios for stroke or TIA in patients with resolved atrial fibrillation were 0.76 (95\% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.85, P{$<$}0.001) versus controls with atrial fibrillation and 1.63 (1.46 to 1.83, P{$<$}0.001) versus controls without atrial fibrillation. Adjusted incidence rate ratios for mortality in patients with resolved atrial fibrillation were 0.60 (0.56 to 0.65, P{$<$}0.001) versus controls with atrial fibrillation and 1.13 (1.06 to 1.21, P{$<$}0.001) versus controls without atrial fibrillation. When patients with resolved atrial fibrillation and documented recurrent atrial fibrillation were excluded the adjusted incidence rate ratio for stroke or TIA was 1.45 (1.26 to 1.67, P{$<$}0.001) versus controls without atrial fibrillation. Conclusion Patients with resolved atrial fibrillation remain at higher risk of stroke or TIA than patients without atrial fibrillation. The risk is increased even in those in whom recurrent atrial fibrillation is not documented.

We examined the influence of depression on all‐cause mortality in patients with heart failure. Methods and Results Using Danish medical registries, this nationwide population‐based cohort study included all patients with a first‐time hospitalization for heart failure (1995–2014). All‐cause mortality risks and 19‐year mortality rate ratios were estimated based on Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, time period, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status. The analysis included 9636 patients with and 194~887 patients without a diagnosis of depression. Compared with patients without a history of depression, those with depression had higher 1‐year (36\% versus 33\%) and 5‐year (68\% versus 63\%) mortality risks. Overall, the adjusted mortality rate ratio was 1.03 (95\% CI 1.01–1.06). Compared with no depression, the adjusted mortality rate ratios for mild, moderate, and severe depression, as defined by diagnostic codes, were 1.06 (95\% CI 1.00–1.13), 1.03 (95\% CI 0.99–1.08), and 1.02 (95\% CI 0.96–1.09), respectively. In a subcohort of patients, the mortality rate ratios were modified by left ventricular ejection fraction, with adjusted mortality rate ratios of 1.17 (95\% CI, 1.05–1.31) for ≤35\%, 0.98 (95\% CI 0.81–1.18) for 36\% to 49\%, and 0.96 (95\% CI 0.74–1.25) for ≥50\%. Results were consistent after adjustment for alcohol abuse and smoking. Conclusions A history of depression was an adverse prognostic factor for all‐cause mortality in heart failure patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35\% but not for other heart failure patients.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies demonstrate that a lower blood pressure and decline in blood pressure over months or years are associated with higher mortality in dialysis patients. In contrast, randomized controlled trials lack power to establish benefits of antihypertensive therapy. Patients on long-term dialysis participating in randomized controlled trials and receiving antihypertensive drug therapy were the subject of this meta-analysis. Outcomes assessed were the hazard ratio of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in treated group compared to controls. Among 1202 patients we identified in 5 studies, the overall benefit of antihypertensive therapy compared to control or placebo group had a combined hazard ratio for cardiovascular events of 0.69 (95\% CI 0.56 to 0.84) using a fixed effects model and 0.62 (95\% CI 0.44 to 0.88) using a random effects model. In a sensitivity analysis we found that the hypertensive group had a pooled hazard ratio of 0.49 (95\% CI 0.35 to 0.67), but when normotensives were included in the trial lesser cardiovascular protection was seen (pooled hazard ratio of 0.86 (95\% CI 0.67 to 1.12)). Test for herterogenity between hypertensive and “normotensive-included” groups was significant (p{$<$}0.006). Similar results were seen for risk ratio for death and cardiovascular events. There was evidence of publication bias based on Egger's test and funnel plot. Randomized trials suggest benefit of antihypertensive therapy among hemodialysis patients. Adequately powered randomized trials are required to confirm these observations especially among those with hypertension.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in developed countries. Data on specific and 10-year survival are scarce. This study analyzes overall and disease-specific survival for patients with colorectal cancer and assesses the value of clinical factors on disease-specific survival. METHODS: a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed invasive colorectal cancer cases diagnosed from 1992 to 2007 were identified through the Hospital del Mar Cancer Registry. Five-and 10-year survival functions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess prognostic factors. RESULTS: a total of 2,080 patients with colorectal cancer were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 72 years and 58.5\%were men. By the end of the follow-up period (December 2008), 1,225 patients had died and 68.4\% of deaths were due to colorectal cancer. The 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survival rates were 55.5\% (95\%CI 53.9-57.9\%) and 48.5\% (95\%CI 45.6-51.3\%), respectively. The 5-year specific survival rate improved in the last period (2003-2007) (60.4\%, 95\%CI 55.4-65.0) compared with 1992-1997(53.4\%; 95\%CI 49.2-57.4) and 1998-2002 (52.0\%; 95\%CI 47.8-56.2). Various factors were independently associated with excess CRC mortality: male sex (HR 1.21), age at diagnosis {$>$} 75 years(HR 1.97), rectal location (HR 1.33), more advanced stages (stage IV: HR 18.54), poorly differentiated/undifferentiated tumors (HR 1.80), and admission through the emergency department (HR 1.52). CONCLUSIONS: cancer-specific survival improved from 1992 to 2007. This improvement could be due to more effective treatment, since changes in stage distribution or age at diagnosis were not observed during the study period. Overall survival rates should notably improve with the implementation of a population-based colorectal cancer screening program in Spain.},

Methods We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program to identify 1,260,898 patients diagnosed in 2004 through 2008 with lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, prostate, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, head/neck, ovarian, or esophageal cancer. We used multivariable logistic and Cox regression to analyze the 734,889 patients who had clinical and follow-up information available.   Results Married patients were less likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.84; P {$<$} .001), more likely to receive definitive therapy (adjusted OR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.51 to 1.56; P {$<$} .001), and less likely to die as a result of their cancer after adjusting for demographics, stage, and treatment (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.79 to 0.81; P {$<$} .001) than unmarried patients. These associations remained significant when each individual cancer was analyzed (P {$<$} .05 for all end points for each malignancy). The benefit associated with marriage was greater in males than females for all outcome measures analyzed (P {$<$} .001 in all cases). For prostate, breast, colorectal, esophageal, and head/neck cancers, the survival benefit associated with marriage was larger than the published survival benefit of chemotherapy.   Conclusion Even after adjusting for known confounders, unmarried patients are at significantly higher risk of presentation with metastatic cancer, undertreatment, and death resulting from their cancer. This study highlights the potentially significant impact that social support can have on cancer detection, treatment, and survival.},

Subgroup analysis was based on time-trend analysis using year of study baseline and follow up duration. Review manager version 5.3.5 was used for statistical analysis. Risk ratios as a form of relative risk were calculated. Results: 35 studies were included. Results showed: all-cause mortality RR 3.73 (95\% CI 3.19, 4.36) compared to general population, with gender specific mortality RR 1.17 (95\% CI 1.06, 1.29). For cause specific mortality risk (overall and gender specific): cardiovascular disease RR 3.48 (95\% CI 3.14, 3.86) and RR 1.41 (95\% CI 0.92, 2.17); renal disease RR 1.06 (95\% CI 0.89, 1.26) and RR 0.63 (95\% CI 0.38, 1.04); neoplasms RR 1.03 (95\% CI 0.92, 1.16) and RR 1.18 (95\% CI 0.75, 1.86); cerebrovascular disease according to genderRR0.99 (95\% CI 0.66, 1.48), and accidents and suicides according to gender RR 2.30 (95\% CI 1.31, 4.06). Conclusion: This study highlighted increased mortality compared to the general population but improved relative risk mortality over time.

  abstract = {Background We assessed the association between activities of daily living (ADL) and mortality among nursing home residents in Japan. Methods This 1-year prospective cohort study investigated 8902 elderly adults in 140 nursing homes. Baseline measurements included age, sex, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), ADL, and dementia level. ADL levels were obtained by caregivers, using the Barthel Index (BI), after which total BI scores were calculated (higher scores indicate less dependence). Information on dates of discharge and mortality was also obtained to calculate person-years. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Results Mean age was 84.3 years, and mean total BI score was 38.5. The HRs of mortality adjusted for sex, age, BMI, and type of nursing home were 7.6 (95\% CI: 3.3–17.8) for those with a BI score of 0 (totally dependent), 3.9 (1.7–9.0) for those with a score of 1 to 10, 3.5 (1.4–8.7) for those with a score of 11 to 40, 2.7 (1.4–5.1) for those with a score of 41 to 70, and 1.3 (0.7–2.4) for those with a score of 71 to 99 (P for trend {$<$}0.001), as compared with those with a score of 100. Multivariate analysis revealed that BI, sex, age, and BMI were significantly associated with mortality rate. Conclusions There was a clear inverse association between ADL level and mortality. In conjunction with other risk factors, ADL level might effectively predict short-term mortality in institutionalized elderly adults.},

  abstract = {Purpose Obesity is an established risk factor for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however, some reports suggest that RCC developing in obese patients may be more indolent. We investigated the clinical and biologic effect of body mass index (BMI) on treatment outcomes in patients with metastatic RCC. Methods The impact of BMI (high BMI: ≥ 25 kg/m2 v low BMI: {$<$} 25 kg/m2) on overall survival (OS) and treatment outcome with targeted therapy was investigated in 1,975 patients from the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) and in an external validation cohort of 4,657 patients. Gene expression profiling focusing on fatty acid metabolism pathway, in The Cancer Genome Atlas data set, and immunohistochemistry staining for fatty acid synthase (FASN) were also investigated. Cox regression was undertaken to estimate the association of BMI with OS, adjusted for the IMDC prognostic factors. Results In the IMDC cohort, median OS was 25.6 months (95\% CI, 23.2 to 28.6) in patients with high BMI versus 17.1 months (95\% CI, 15.5 to 18.5) in patients with low BMI (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 0.95). In the validation cohort, high BMI was associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.93; medians: 23.4 months [95\% CI, 21.9 to 25.3 months] v 14.5 months [95\% CI, 13.8 to 15.9 months], respectively). In The Cancer Genome Atlas data set (n = 61), FASN gene expression inversely correlated with BMI (P = .034), and OS was longer in the low FASN expression group (medians: 36.8 v 15.0 months; P = .002). FASN immunohistochemistry positivity was more frequently detected in IMDC poor (48\%) and intermediate (34\%) risk groups than in the favorable risk group (17\%; P-trend = .015). Conclusion High BMI is a prognostic factor for improved survival and progression-free survival in patients with metastatic RCC treated with targeted therapy. Underlying biology suggests a role for the FASN pathway.},

PS matching was used to adjust for confounding covariates. OS and PFS were compared between diabetic and nondiabetic matched pairs and between matched pairs of diabetic patients with or without metformin therapy.

Comprehensive risk-scoring models were developed to estimate OS in low-grade and high-grade EC. Methods Patients undergoing primary surgery for EC from 1999 through 2008 were stratified histologically according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) as either (i) low grade: grades 1 and 2 endometrioid EC or (ii) high grade: grade 3, including non-endometrioid EC. Associations between patient-, pathological-, and treatment-specific risk factors and OS starting on postoperative day 30 were assessed using multivariable Cox regression models. Factors independently associated with OS were used to construct nomograms and risk-scoring models. Results Eligible patients (N= 1281) included 925 low-grade and 356 high-grade patients; estimated 5-year OSs were 87.0\% and 51.5\%, respectively. Among patients alive at last follow-up, median follow-up was 5.0 (low grade) and 4.6 years (high grade), respectively. In low-grade patients, independent factors predictive of compromised OS included age, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary dysfunction, stage, tumor diameter, pelvic lymph node status, and grade 2 or higher 30-day postoperative complications. Among high-grade patients, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, stage, lymphovascular space invasion, adjuvant therapy, para-aortic nodal status, and cervical stromal invasion were independent predictors of compromised OS. The two risk-scoring models/nomograms had excellent calibration and discrimination (unbiased c-indices = 0.803 and 0.759). Conclusion Patients with low-grade and high-grade EC can be counseled regarding their predicted OS using the proposed risk-scoring models. This may facilitate institution of personalized treatment algorithms, surveillance strategies, and lifestyle interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To assess the prognostic factors that could be used to predict tumour recurrence and progression, and to construct and validate a predictive index. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between June 1991 and December 2000, 533 patients (418 men and 115 women; mean age 55.4~years) underwent complete transurethral resection of histologically confirmed pTa and pT1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, after which 377 (test series) were randomized into two subsequent studies, of six groups, to receive adjuvant intravesical sequential bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and epirubicin, BCG alone, epirubicin (50~or 80~mg), adriamycin 50~mg or no adjuvant therapy. Factors potentially affecting tumour recurrence or progression were assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis, i.e. tumour stage, histological grade, DNA ploidy, history of recurrence, multiplicity, size, tumour configuration, associated carcinoma in situ, recurrence at the first 3-month check cystoscopy and the use of adjuvant therapy. The regression coefficients determined by Cox regression analysis were used to construct a predictive index (PI). The algebraic sum of the regression coefficients of the factors with independent and significant association with disease-free survival for each case represented a proportional hazard score (PHS). The PI was validated in another series of 156 patients (validation series) in whom the same regression coefficients for the same significant factors as the test series were used to categorize it into three risk groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to compare the different risk categories in both test and validation series. RESULTS The mean (sd, range) follow-up in the test and validation series were 58 (19, 5–96) and 28.3~(14.9, 2–94)~months, respectively. In the test series, tumour stage, DNA ploidy, multiplicity, history of recurrence, tumour configuration, cystoscopy result and the type of adjuvant therapy had independent significance for recurrence on multivariate analysis. For progression, the cystoscopy result, DNA ploidy and grade were the only independent and significant predictors. The ranges of PHS for the factors affecting recurrence-free and progression-free survival were 0.0–7.14 and 0.0–5.84, respectively, which were divided equally into three risk categories with significant differences on Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank test (P~{$<~$}0.001). The three categories in the validation series were significantly different from each other and each was comparable with that in the test series. CONCLUSIONS Tumour stage, DNA ploidy, multiplicity, history of recurrence, tumour configuration and type of adjuvant therapy affected independently the rate of recurrence after resecting superficial bladder tumour.

  abstract = {Objective To develop a simple prognostic index for anticipating more precisely the early clinical course of primary superficial bladder cancer. Patients and methods The prognostic value of patient and tumour characteristics was examined in 333 patients with primary Ta or T1 bladder cancer who participated in a multicentre prospective study already completed. Primary tumour multiplicity, a diameter of {$>$}3~cm, stage T1, and grade 2 or 3 were independent predictors of earlier recurrence in a multivariate analysis. A simplified prognostic index consisted of the number of adverse tumour characteristics (ATCs) initially present. Results After a median follow-up of 35.3 months, the 60 patients free of ATCs (19\%) had a recurrence-free probability at 12 and 24 months of 86\% and 69\%, respectively, and none experienced progression. Recurrence outcomes deteriorated consistently as the number of ATCs increased among the other three groups. In patients with 3–4 ATCs, the 12- and 24-month recurrence-free probability was as low as 30\% and 19\%, and recurrence and tumour rates were about 2.6 times higher than in patients free of ATCs; 7\% of these patients experienced progression within 35 months of follow-up. Conclusion A prognostic index based on the number of ATCs (primary tumour multiplicity, diameter {$>$}3~cm, stage T1, and grade 2 or 3) is a strong indicator of the clinical course of superficial bladder cancer within 3 years of the first endoscopic resection. This proposal is suggested for discussion and for validation in future studies but if confirmed, this simple prognostic index may greatly help to identify indicators for adjuvant intravesical therapy and to determine the optimal periodicity of control cystoscopy regimens.},

  abstract = {Background Worldwide data for cancer survival are scarce. We aimed to initiate worldwide surveillance of cancer survival by central analysis of population-based registry data, as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems, and to inform global policy on cancer control. Methods Individual tumour records were submitted by 279 population-based cancer registries in 67 countries for 25·7 million adults (age 15–99 years) and 75 000 children (age 0–14 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1995–2009 and followed up to Dec 31, 2009, or later. We looked at cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, and prostate in adults, and adult and childhood leukaemia. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were corrected by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival, adjusted for background mortality in every country or region by age (single year), sex, and calendar year, and by race or ethnic origin in some countries. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Findings 5-year survival from colon, rectal, and breast cancers has increased steadily in most developed countries. For patients diagnosed during 2005–09, survival for colon and rectal cancer reached 60\% or more in 22 countries around the world; for breast cancer, 5-year survival rose to 85\% or higher in 17 countries worldwide. Liver and lung cancer remain lethal in all nations: for both cancers, 5-year survival is below 20\% everywhere in Europe, in the range 15–19\% in North America, and as low as 7–9\% in Mongolia and Thailand. Striking rises in 5-year survival from prostate cancer have occurred in many countries: survival rose by 10–20\% between 1995–99 and 2005–09 in 22 countries in South America, Asia, and Europe, but survival still varies widely around the world, from less than 60\% in Bulgaria and Thailand to 95\% or more in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the USA. For cervical cancer, national estimates of 5-year survival range from less than 50\% to more than 70\%; regional variations are much wider, and improvements between 1995–99 and 2005–09 have generally been slight. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005–09, 5-year survival was 40\% or higher only in Ecuador, the USA, and 17 countries in Asia and Europe. 5-year survival for stomach cancer in 2005–09 was high (54–58\%) in Japan and South Korea, compared with less than 40\% in other countries. By contrast, 5-year survival from adult leukaemia in Japan and South Korea (18–23\%) is lower than in most other countries. 5-year survival from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less than 60\% in several countries, but as high as 90\% in Canada and four European countries, which suggests major deficiencies in the management of a largely curable disease. Interpretation International comparison of survival trends reveals very wide differences that are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimum treatment. Continuous worldwide surveillance of cancer survival should become an indispensable source of information for cancer patients and researchers and a stimulus for politicians to improve health policy and health-care systems.

The aim of this review was to examine the scope of recurrent falls and to identify factors associated with recurrent fallers. A database search for journal articles which reported prospectively collected information concerning recurrent falls in people with PD identified 22 studies. In these studies, 60.5\% (range 35 to 90\%) of participants reported at least one fall, with 39\% (range 18 to 65\%) reporting recurrent falls. Recurrent fallers reported an average of 4.7 to 67.6 falls per person per year (overall average 20.8 falls). Factors associated with recurrent falls include: a positive fall history, increased disease severity and duration, increased motor impairment, treatment with dopamine agonists, increased levodopa dosage, cognitive impairment, fear of falling, freezing of gait, impaired mobility and reduced physical activity. The wide range in the frequency of recurrent falls experienced by people with PD suggests that it would be beneficial to classify recurrent fallers into sub-groups based on fall frequency. Given that there are several factors particularly associated with recurrent falls, fall management and prevention strategies specifically targeting recurrent fallers require urgent evaluation in order to inform clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Pancreatic diseases place significant burdens on health care systems worldwide. However, there is lack of agreement about which factors increase or reduce risk for pancreatic disease. We reviewed high-quality studies of factors that affect risk for pancreatic diseases in the general population. Methods We searched 3 databases (Medline, Embase, and Scopus) for prospective cohort studies of modifiable risk and/or protective factors for acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer in adult populations. Factors that were investigated in 2 or more studies were assessed by meta-analysis if the required data were available. Subgroup analyses were performed when appropriate. Outcome measures were relative risk (RR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results Our analysis included 51 population-based studies with more than 3 million individuals and nearly 11,000 patients with pancreatic diseases. A total of 31 different factors were investigated. Current tobacco use was the single most important risk factor for pancreatic diseases (RR, 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.54–2.27), followed by obesity (RR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.15–1.92) and heavy use of alcohol (RR, 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.19–1.58). Tobacco and heavy use of alcohol had bigger effects on risk of acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis than pancreatic cancer. Vegetable consumption (RR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.57–0.88) and fruit consumption (RR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.60–0.90) provided the greatest degree of protection against pancreatic diseases on the basis of meta-analyses. Vegetable consumption had stronger association with protection against acute pancreatitis and fruit consumption with protection against pancreatic cancer. Conclusions On the basis of systematic review and meta-analysis, current tobacco use, obesity, and heavy use of alcohol are associated with significant increases in risk for pancreatic diseases. Vegetables and fruit consumption are associated with reduced risk for pancreatic diseases. Prevention strategies for acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer should consider these factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The association between obesity and mortality is reduced or eliminated in older subjects. In addition to mortality, disability is an important health outcome. The objectives of this study were to examine the association between body mass index (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, and subsequent disability and mortality among older Americans, as well as to estimate the effect of BMI on life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy among older Americans. METHODS We studied 8359 non-Hispanic white Americans, 1931 African Americans, and 2435 Mexican Americans 65 years or older who were not disabled at baseline from 5 sites of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Measures included BMI, medical conditions, activities of daily living, and demographic information. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for subsequent disability and mortality during 7 years of follow-up. Total life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy were estimated using the interpolation of Markov chain approach. RESULTS The lowest HR (1.02; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-1.10) for disability was at a BMI of 25 to less than 30. Subjects with BMIs of lower than 18.5 or 30 or higher at baseline were significantly more likely to experience disability during the follow-up period. In contrast, the lowest HRs for mortality were seen among subjects with BMIs of 25 to less than 30 (HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.85) and 30 to less than 35 (HR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.90), with subjects with BMIs of lower than 25 or 35 or higher experiencing higher hazards for mortality. Disability-free life expectancy is greatest among subjects with a BMI of 25 to less than 30. CONCLUSION Assessments of the effect of obesity on the health of older Americans should account for mortality and incidence of disability.},

  abstract = {Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is the most severe form of alcoholic liver disease. Most studies have focused on short-term prognosis, whereas factors associated with long-term survival are largely unknown. The aims of our study were to (1) determine the impact of complete abstinence from alcohol on long-term survival and (2) identify prognostic factors at admission capable of predicting abstinence during long-term follow-up in patients with AH. One hundred forty-two patients with biopsy-proven AH that survived the first episode were included. Demographic, psychiatric, and biochemical variables at admission and drinking status during follow-up were obtained. Cox regression, logistic regression, and classification and regression trees (CART) analyses were used for statistical analysis. Overall mortality was 38\% with a median follow-up of 55 months. During follow-up, complete abstinence was reported in 39\% and was associated with better long-term survival (hazard ratio, 0.53; P = 0.03). After adjustment for baseline prognostic scoring systems (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and age, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, creatinine scores), complete abstinence was independently associated with survival (P {$<$} 0.05). Age and lack of past alcoholism treatments were independently associated with complete abstinence (P {$<$} 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively) during follow-up. CART analysis generated a simple and practical algorithm based on the combination of past alcoholism treatments and age. Using CART analysis, we stratified 2 subgroups of patients with high (65\%) and low (26\%-29\%) rates of complete abstinence after an episode of AH. Conclusion: Complete abstinence after an episode of AH positively impacts long-term survival. The combination of 2 variables easily obtained at admission might be useful to predict long-term abstinence after an episode of AH. Strategies aimed at promoting alcohol abstinence in these patients are necessary. (Hepatology 2017;66:1842–1853)},

Aim of this study was to evaluate the association between different EBM combinations at discharge and long-term survival after AMI.MethodsFrom a German population-based AMI registry, 2,886 men and 958 women were included, aged 28–74 years, hospitalized with an incident AMI between 2000 and 2008. All data were collected by standardized interviews and chart review. All-cause mortality was assessed for all registered persons in 2010. Median follow-up time was 6.0 years (interquartile range 4.1 years). Survival analyses and multivariate Cox regression analysis were conducted.ResultsOf the 3,844 patients, 70.3 \% were prescribed all four EBMs; 23.8 \% received three, 4.6 \% two, and 1.3 \% were discharged with one or no EBM. Long-term survival was 71.7 \% [95 \% confidence interval (CI) 55.4–82.9 \%], 64.7 \% (95 \% CI 59.2–69.6 \%) and 60.2 \% (95 \% CI 51.9–67.5 \%) in patients with four, three and {$<$}3 EBMs, respectively. Patients prescribed three or less EBMs without ACEI/ARB showed similar long-term survival to those receiving four EBMs. In Cox regression analysis after adjustment for confounding variables, the hazard ratio for long-term mortality in patients with four EBMs versus three or less EBMs was 0.63 (95 \% CI 0.53–0.74).ConclusionsPrescribing of a combination of all four EBMs appeared to improve clinical outcomes in AMI patients by significantly reducing long-term mortality.

  abstract = {Few studies have assessed which biomarkers influence mortality risk among those with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We analyzed data from 556 individuals identified to have PAD (i.e. ankle–brachial index ⩽0.9) with available measurements of C-reactive protein, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), homocysteine, and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We investigated whether a combination of these biomarkers improved the prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality beyond conventional risk factors. During follow-up (median, 8.1 years), 277 of 556 participants died; 63 deaths were attributed to cardiovascular disease. After adjusting for conventional risk factors, Cox proportional-hazards models showed the following to be most strongly associated with all-cause mortality (each is followed by the adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per 1 standard deviation increment in the log values): homocysteine (1.31), UACR (1.21), and NLR (1.20). UACR alone significantly predicted cardiovascular mortality (1.53). Persons in the highest quintile of multimarker scores derived from regression coefficients of significant biomarkers had elevated risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 2.45; 95\% CI, 1.66–3.62; p for trend, {$<$}0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR, 2.20; 95\% CI, 1.02–4.71; p for trend, 0.053) compared to those in the lowest two quintiles. The addition of continuous multimarker scores to conventional risk factors improved risk stratification of all-cause mortality (integrated discrimination improvement [IDI], 0.162; p{$<$}0.00001) and cardiovascular mortality (IDI, 0.058; p{$<$}0.00001). In conclusion, the addition of a continuous multimarker score to conventional risk factors improved mortality prediction among patients with PAD.},

The association between obesity and risk of recurrent stroke is unclear.AimsThe study aims to investigate the association in stroke patients between body mass index and risk of death and readmission for recurrent stroke.MethodsAn administrative Danish quality-control registry designed to collect a predefined dataset on all hospitalized stroke patients in Denmark 2000?2010 includes 45 615 acute first-ever stroke patients with information on body mass index in 29 326. Data include age, gender, civil status, stroke severity, computed tomography, and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients were followed up to 9·8 years (median 2·6 years). We used Cox regression models to compare risk of death and readmission for recurrent stroke in the four body mass index groups: underweight (body mass index {$<$} 18·5), normal weight (body mass index 18·5?24·9), overweight (body mass index 25·0?29·9), obese (body mass index ? 30·0).ResultsMean age 72·3 years, 48\% women. Mean body mass index 23·0. Within follow-up, 7902 (26·9\%) patients had died; 2437 (8·3\%) were readmitted because of recurrent stroke. Mortality was significantly lower in overweight (hazard ratio 0·72; confidence interval 0·68?0·78) and obese (hazard ratio 0·80; confidence interval 0·73?0·88) patients while significantly higher in underweight patients (hazard ratio 1·66; confidence interval 1·49?1·84) compared with normal weight patients. Risk of readmission for recurrent stroke was significantly lower in obese than in normal weight patients (hazard ratio 0·84; confidence interval 0·72?0·92).ConclusionsxObesity was not only associated with reduced mortality relative to normal weight patients. Compared with normal weight, risk of readmission for recurrent stroke was also lower in obese stroke patients.},

  abstract = {Background: Patients with Barrett’s oesophagus have an increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma but this cancer only accounts for a small proportion of deaths in these patients. Other causes of death are reportedly raised in this group. We examined cause specific mortality among individuals in a population based Barrett’s oesophagus register. Methods: We constructed a register of all patients diagnosed with columnar mucosa (including specialised intestinal metaplasia) of the oesophagus within Northern Ireland between 1993 and 1999. Deaths occurring within this cohort until 31 December 2000 were identified and mortality rates were compared with the general population. Results: Overall mortality was not raised in Barrett’s patients. During 7413 person years of follow up in 2373 patients there were 253 deaths (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 96 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 84–107)). Mortality from oesophageal cancer was raised in patients with specialised intestinal metaplasia (SMR 774 (95\% CI 317–1231)) but only 4.7\% of patients died from this cancer. Mortality from stroke (SMR 65 (95\% CI 37–93)) was significantly lower than the general population while mortality from non-cancerous digestive system diseases was significantly higher (SMR 211 (95\% CI 111–311)). Mortality rates from all other causes were similar to those of the general population. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the overall mortality rate in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus is closely similar to that of the general population. Oesophageal cancer mortality was raised but is an uncommon cause of death in these patients who also appear to have a reduced risk of death from stroke.},

Methods and results A total of 272 186 patients (44\% women) ≤85 years at the time of hospitalization with incidental AF 1995–2008 and 544 344 matched controls free of in-hospital diagnosis of AF were identified. Patients were followed via record linkage of the Swedish National Patient Registry and the Cause of Death Registry. Using Cox regression models, the long-term relative all-cause mortality risk, adjusted for concomitant diseases, in women vs. controls was 2.15, 1.72, and 1.44 (P {$<$} 0.001) in the age categories ≤65, 65–74, and 75–85 years, respectively. The corresponding figures for men were 1.76, 1.36, and 1.24 (P {$<$} 0.001). Among concomitant diseases, neoplasm, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contributed most to the increased all-cause mortality vs. controls. In patients with AF as the primary diagnosis, the relative risk of mortality was 1.63, 1.46, and 1.28 (P {$<$} 0.001) in women and 1.45, 1.17, and 1.10 (P {$<$} 0.001) in men. Conclusion Atrial fibrillation was an independent risk factor of all-cause mortality in patients with incident AF. The concomitant diseases that contributed most were found outside the thromboembolic risk scores. The highest relative risk of mortality was seen in women and in the youngest patients compared with controls, and the differences between genders in each age category were statistically significant.},

METHODS: Patients from the Skaraborg Diabetes Register with prospectively registered new-onset type 2 diabetes 1991-2004 were included. Five individual controls matched for sex, age, geographical area and calendar year of study entry were selected using population records. Causes of deaths until 31 December 2014 were retrieved from the Cause of Death Register. Adjusted excess mortality among patients and temporal changes of excess mortality were calculated using Poisson models. Cumulative incidences of cause-specific mortality were calculated by competing risk regression. RESULTS: During 24 years of follow-up 4364 deaths occurred among 7461 patients in 90,529 person-years (48.2/1000 person-years, 95\% CI 46.8-49.7), and 18,541 deaths in 479,428 person-years among 37,271 controls (38.7/1000 person-years, 38.1-39.2). The overall adjusted mortality hazard ratio was 1.47 (p {$<$} .0001) among patients diagnosed at study start 1991 and decreased by 2\% (p {$<$} .0001) per increase in calendar year of diagnosis until 2004. Excess mortality was mainly attributed to endocrine and cardiovascular cause of death with crude subdistributional hazard ratios of 5.06 (p {$<$} .001) and 1.22 (p {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: Excess mortality for patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes was mainly attributed to deaths related to diabetes and the cardiovascular system, and decreased with increasing year of diagnosis 1991-2004. Possible explanations could be temporal trends of earlier diagnosis due to lowered diagnostic thresholds and intensified diagnostic activities, as well as improved treatment.},

The hypertensive men were having stepped care treatment with either β adrenergic blocking drugs, thiazide diuretics, or combination treatment. Mortality, morbidity, and adverse effects were registered at yearly examinations and from death certificates. , Main outcome measures: All cause mortality and cause specific mortality. , Results: Treated hypertensive men had significantly impaired probability of total survival as well as survival from coronary heart disease and stroke. All cause mortality as well as coronary heart disease and stroke mortality were very similar in hypertensive men and normotensive men during the first decade, but increased steadily thereafter despite continuous good blood pressure control. Smoking, signs of target organ damage, and high serum cholesterol levels, but not blood pressure at screening, were significantly related to the incidence of coronary heart disease during follow up. In time dependent Cox’s regression analysis, the incidence of coronary heart disease was significantly related only to serum cholesterol concentrations in the study. Cancer mortality was almost similar in treated hypertensive men (61/686, 8.9\%) and non-hypertensive men (732/6810, 10.8\%). , Conclusion: Treated hypertensive men had impaired survival and increased mortality from cardiovascular disease compared with non-hypertensive men of similar age. These differences were observed during the second decade of follow up. During an observation period of 22-23 years—about 15\,000 patient years—hypertensive men receiving diuretics and β blockers had no increased risk of cancer or non-cardiovascular disease. ,  Key messages Hypertension is a prevalent (10-20\%) and important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In controlled trials over 3-5 years drug treatment for hypertension prevents these complications, but little is known about long term prognosis During 20-22 years treated hypertensive men had a significantly increased mortality, especially from coronary heart disease, compared with non-hypertensive men from the same population The high incidence of myocardial infarction was related to organ damage, smoking, and cholesterol at the time of entry to the study, and to achieved serum cholesterol concentrations during follow up The poor prognosis for mortality from coronary heart disease is dependent upon strict monitoring of serum cholesterol concentrations},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Histologic analysis of liver biopsy specimens allows for grading and staging of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We performed a longitudinal study to investigate the long-term prognostic relevance of histologic features for patients with NAFLD. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 619 patients diagnosed with NAFLD from 1975 through 2005 at medical centers in the United States, Europe, and Thailand. Patients underwent laboratory and biopsy analyses, and were examined every 3–12 months after their diagnosis. Outcomes analyzed were overall mortality, liver transplantation, and liver-related events. Cumulative outcomes were compared by log-rank analysis. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Time at risk was determined from the date of liver biopsy to the date of outcome or last follow-up examination. Results Over a median follow-up period of 12.6 years (range, 0.3–35.1 y), 193 of the patients (33.2\%) died or underwent liver transplantation. Features of liver biopsies significantly associated with death or liver transplantation included fibrosis stage 1 (HR, 1.88; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–2.77), stage 2 (HR, 2.89; 95\% CI, 1.93–4.33), stage 3 (HR, 3.76; 95\% CI, 2.40–5.89), and stage 4 (HR, 10.9; 95\% CI, 6.06–19.62) compared with stage 0, as well as age (HR, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.05–1.08), diabetes (HR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.13–2.30), current smoking (HR, 2.62; 95\% CI, 1.67–4.10), and statin use (HR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.14–0.70). Twenty-six patients (4.2\%) developed liver-related events; fibrosis stage 3 (HR, 14.2; 95\% CI, 3.38–59.68) and stage 4 (HR, 51.5; 95\% CI, 9.87–269.2) compared with stage 0, were associated significantly with the events. Patients with fibrosis, regardless of steatohepatitis or NAFLD activity score, had shorter survival times than patients without fibrosis. Conclusions In a longitudinal study of patients with NAFLD, fibrosis stage, but no other histologic features of steatohepatitis, were associated independently with long-term overall mortality, liver transplantation, and liver-related events.},

  abstract = {Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and advanced liver fibrosis are at the highest risk for progressing to end-stage liver disease. We constructed and validated a scoring system consisting of routinely measured and readily available clinical and laboratory data to separate NAFLD patients with and without advanced fibrosis. A total of 733 patients with NAFLD confirmed by liver biopsy were divided into 2 groups to construct (n = 480) and validate (n = 253) a scoring system. Routine demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were analyzed by multivariate modeling to predict presence or absence of advanced fibrosis. Age, hyperglycemia, body mass index, platelet count, albumin, and AST/ALT ratio were independent indicators of advanced liver fibrosis. A scoring system with these 6 variables had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 and 0.82 in the estimation and validation groups, respectively. By applying the low cutoff score (−1.455), advanced fibrosis could be excluded with high accuracy (negative predictive value of 93\% and 88\% in the estimation and validation groups, respectively). By applying the high cutoff score (0.676), the presence of advanced fibrosis could be diagnosed with high accuracy (positive predictive value of 90\% and 82\% in the estimation and validation groups, respectively). By applying this model, a liver biopsy would have been avoided in 549 (75\%) of the 733 patients, with correct prediction in 496 (90\%). Conclusion: a simple scoring system accurately separates patients with NAFLD with and without advanced fibrosis, rendering liver biopsy for identification of advanced fibrosis unnecessary in a substantial proportion of patients.

  abstract = {What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? * The increased detection of small renal masses (SRMs) with diagnostic imaging has highlighted the importance of preserving renal function, with many patients with SRMs being managed with nephron-sparing procedures. The significance of positive surgical margins (PSMs) is debatable and various studies have looked at the risk factors for PSMs and recurrence. It has been suggested that tumour size may be a risk factor and the centrality of the tumour has been found to be an increased risk factor. The indication and location of the tumour has been found to be an independent predictive factor for recurrence. * Various studies have assessed the outcome of patients with PSMs with short- to intermediate-term follow-up. Our study has an intermediate-term median follow-up of 7.9 years, and found no significant difference in 5-year disease-specific and overall survival rates between patients with PSMs and negative surgical margins. We also found that tumour size was not significant, but pathological stage and fat invasion were found to be significant. These risk factors have not been published in previous studies. Objectives * To determine the prevalence of positive surgical margins (PSMs) on a population level. * To identify the predictors of PSMs and assess their impact on survival. Patients and Methods * Using the Ontario Cancer Registry, we reviewed pathology reports on 664 patients after partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma between 1995 and 2004. * Demographic information and pathological characteristics were obtained and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of PSMs. * Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to examine disease-specific (DSS) and overall survival (OS) by margin status. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the independent association between PSMs and survival. Results * The mean patient age was 57.7 years and 61.6\% were men. Tumour size was {$<$}2.0\,cm in 25\%, 2.0–3.9\,cm in 59\%, 4.0–6.9\,cm in 13\%, and ≥7.0\,cm in 3\% of patients. * Seventy-one patients (10.7\%) had PSMs on final pathology. Only stage (P = 0.02) and fat invasion (P = 0.04) were significantly associated with PSMs. * At a median follow-up of 7.9 years, the unadjusted 5-year DSS and OS rates were 91.8 and 88.3\%, respectively. * Survival rates did not differ by surgical margin status, with 90.9 and 84.4\% 5-year DSS and OS rates for patients with PSMs compared with 91.9 and 88.6\% for those with a negative surgical margin (P = 0.58, log rank test). * Using a Cox proportional hazards model, surgical margin status was not associated with time to all-cause death (P = 0.67). Conclusion * Our population-level data suggest that, although PSMs are fairly prevalent, they appear to have little to no impact on 5-year survival rates.},

Older study patients with AML presented with poorer performance status, lower white blood cell counts, and a lower percentage of marrow blasts. Multidrug resistance was found in 33\% of AMLs in patients younger than age 56 compared with 57\% in patients older than 75. The percentage of patients with favorable cytogenetics dropped from 17\% in those younger than age 56 to 4\% in those older than 75. In contrast, the proportion of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics increased from 35\% in those younger than age 56 to 51\% in patients older than 75. Particularly striking were the increases in abnormalities of chromosomes 5, 7, and 17 among the elderly. The increased incidence of unfavorable cytogenetics contributed to their poorer outcome, and, within each cytogenetic risk group, treatment outcome deteriorated markedly with age. Finally, the combination of a poor performance status and advanced age identified a group of patients with a very high likelihood of dying within 30 days of initiating induction therapy. The distinct biology and clinical responses seen argue for age-specific assessments when evaluating therapies for AML.},

Background Limited data are available regarding survival in patients with PCA identified in the clinical setting by noninvasive lower extremity arterial evaluation. Methods We conducted a historical cohort study of consecutive patients who underwent outpatient, noninvasive lower extremity arterial evaluation at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 1998 through December 2007, and who were followed for a mean duration of 5.8 ± 3.1 years. An ABI 1.00 to 1.30 was considered normal, PAD was defined as a resting or post-exercise ABI ≤0.90, and PCA defined as an ABI ≥1.4 and/or an ankle systolic blood pressure {$>$}255 mm Hg. Patients were followed for all-cause mortality through September 30, 2009. Results Of 16,493 individuals (mean age 67.8 ± 13.0 years, 59\% male); 29\% had normal ABI, 54\% had PAD, and 17\% had PCA. During follow-up (mean duration 5.8 ± 3.1 years), 4,365 patients (26\%) died. The percent alive at the end of the study period was 88\%, 70\%, and 60\% for normal ABI, PAD, and PCA, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbid conditions, and medication use, the hazard ratios (95\% confidence intervals) of death associated with PCA were 2.0 (1.8 to 2.2) and 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4) compared with the normal ABI and PAD groups, respectively. Conclusions Patients identified by noninvasive vascular testing to have poorly compressible leg arteries have poor survival, worse than those with a normal ABI or those with PAD.},

  abstract = {It is known that cigarette smoking induces leukocytosis and increased genetic instability in normal individuals. Therefore, a retrospective review was conducted of 173 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to detect a possible influence of cigarette smoking on initial characteristics at the time of presentation and on the course of this disease. Thirty-nine patients (23\%) were smoking 5 cigarettes/d or more at time of diagnosis. Cigarette smoking was significantly related to male sex (P = 0.0005) and younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.02) and smokers tended to have lower leukocyte counts (P = 0.07) than nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with early blast crisis (P {$<$} 0.0001) and short survival (P {$<$} 0.0001). Other characteristics associated with a poor prognosis included hepatomegaly, anemia, and a high percentage of peripheral blast cells at time of diagnosis. When studied in a multivariate analysis, cigarette smoking remained the strongest prognostic factor for both occurrence of blast crisis (P = 0.0003) and overall survival (P = 0.0001). Other poor prognosis factors found in the multivariate analysis included a high percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood at time of diagnosis and high platelet count. It is possible that cigarette smoke may act as a promoter or cocarcinogen in the transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia.},

We analyzed 2492 patients in the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) study. Body mass index (BMI) was evaluated as a categorical variable (normal: 18.5 to {$<$}25; overweight: 25 to {$<$}30; obese: ≥ 30). The rate of death from any cause was higher in the normal BMI group (5.8 per 100 patient-years) than in the overweight and obese groups (3.9 and 3.7, respectively). The cardiovascular death rate was highest in the normal BMI group (3.1 per 100 patient-years), lowest in the overweight group (1.5 per 100 patient-years), and intermediate in the obese group (2.1 per 100 patient-years). After adjustment for baseline factors, differences in the risk of death from any cause were no longer significant. However, overweight remained associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular death (Hazard ratio 0.47, p=0.002). Obese patients were more likely to have an uncontrolled resting heart rate, but rhythm control strategy success was similar across BMI categories. In each of the BMI categories, the risk of death from any cause was similar for patients randomized to a rhythm or a rate control strategy. In conclusion, among patients with established AF, overweight and obesity do not adversely affect overall survival. Obesity does not appear to impact the relative benefit of a rate or rhythm control strategy.},

Methods We examined pre-diagnosis BMI and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity in relation to overall and disease-specific survival among 983 postmenopausal women who were diagnosed with endometrial cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trials. Results Over a median 5.2 (max 14.1) years from diagnosis to death or end of follow-up, 163 total deaths were observed, 66 of which were due to endometrial cancer. We observed a higher all-cause mortality hazard ratio (HR)=1.85 (95\% CI 1.19–2.88) comparing women with a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 to women with BMI {$<$}25 kg/m2. For endometrial cancer-specific mortality the HR=2.23 (95\% CI 1.09–4.54) comparing extreme BMI categories. To examine histologic subtypes we analyzed type I endometrial tumors separately and found a HR=1.20 (95\% CI 1.07–1.35) associated with all-cause mortality for each 5-unit change in BMI. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity was not associated with all-cause or endometrial cancer-specific mortality. Conclusions Pre-diagnosis BMI, but not physical activity, was associated with survival among women with endometrial cancer. Future studies should investigate mechanisms and timing of BMI onset to better understand the burden of disease attributable to BMI.},

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality.ResultsWith a median follow-up time of 7.1 years, we observed 91 total deaths.

Adults with any sarcoidosis-coded visit were identified from the National Patient Register (hospitalisations 1964–2013 and outpatient care 2001–2013). Demographic and medication dispensing data were retrieved from national registers. We estimated the prevalence of sarcoidosis in 2013 overall and by county of residence. The incidence of sarcoidosis during 2003–2012 was estimated by sex, age, education level and year of diagnosis. Case definitions were varied to test their robustness. More than 16 000 individuals had a history of sarcoidosis in 2013. When defined as two or more sarcoidosis-coded visits, the prevalence was 160 per 100 000. Using different definitions, the prevalence ranged from 152 (requiring a specialist visit) to 215 per 100 000 (only one visit required). The highest prevalence was observed in northern less densely populated counties. The incidence was 11.5 per 100 000 per year and varied by −10\% to +30\% depending on case definition. The incidence peaked in males aged 30–50 years and in females aged 50–60 years, but did not differ by education level and was stable over time. This study represents the largest epidemiological investigation of sarcoidosis using population-based individual-level data.

In the 19 included jurisdictions, over 1995–2014, 1-year and 5-year net survival increased in each country across almost all cancer types, with, for example, 5-year rectal cancer survival increasing more than 13 percentage points in Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. For 2010–14, survival was generally higher in Australia, Canada, and Norway than in New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. Over the study period, larger survival improvements were observed for patients younger than 75 years at diagnosis than those aged 75 years and older, and notably for cancers with a poor prognosis (ie, oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, and lung). Progress in cancer control (ie, increased survival, decreased mortality and incidence) over the study period was evident for stomach, colon, lung (in males), and ovarian cancer.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The joint evaluation of trends in incidence, mortality, and survival indicated progress in four of the seven studied cancers. Cancer survival continues to increase across high-income countries; however, international disparities persist. While truly valid comparisons require differences in registration practice, classification, and coding to be minimal, stage of disease at diagnosis, timely access to effective treatment, and the extent of comorbidity are likely the main determinants of patient outcomes.

  abstract = {Caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease in men but not in women. This gender difference may be due to an interaction between caffeine and use of postmenopausal estrogens. The authors prospectively assessed the relation between coffee consumption and Parkinson’s disease mortality among participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II, a cohort of over 1 million people enrolled in 1982. Causes of deaths were ascertained through death certificates from January 1, 1989, through 1998. Parkinson’s disease was listed as a cause of death in 909 men and 340 women. After adjustment for age, smoking, and alcohol intake, coffee consumption was inversely associated with Parkinson’s disease mortality in men (ptrend = 0.01) but not in women (p = 0.6). In women, this association was dependent on postmenopausal estrogen use; the relative risk for women drinking 4 or more cups (600 ml) of coffee per day compared with nondrinkers was 0.47 (95\% confidence interval: 0.27, 0.80; p = 0.006) among never users and 1.31 (95\% confidence interval: 0.75, 2.30; p = 0.34) among users. These results suggest that caffeine reduces the risk of Parkinson’s disease but that this hypothetical beneficial effect may be prevented by use of estrogen replacement therapy.},

  abstract = {Background Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a rare melanoma subtype that disproportionately afflicts people of colour. ALMs have a worse prognosis than other melanoma subtypes; this has been attributed to aggressive biological behaviour, more advanced stage at presentation and possible disparities in access to health care. Objectives To examine, using comprehensive patient data and long-term follow-up information in a well-characterized cohort, how patient, tumour and clinical management variables impact overall and melanoma-specific survival. Methods We characterized a consecutive cohort of 123 ALMs diagnosed from 1987 to 2013 and analysed predictors of overall and melanoma-specific survival for their association with survival. Results Univariate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals using Cox regression models showed that increased Breslow depth, presence of ulceration, receipt of radiation, chemo- and vaccine therapy were associated with worse melanoma-specific survival. Notably, nonwhite race/ethnicity was not associated with worse overall or melanoma-specific survival. Multivariate modelling adjusting for patient, tumour and management variables revealed Breslow depth {$>$} 2 mm and disease extent as significantly associated with poor melanoma-specific survival. Conclusions Melanoma-specific mortality among patients with ALM is associated with increased tumour thickness and more advanced stage at presentation, but not with race/ethnicity. Advanced tumour features at presentation and access to care may account for less favourable survival outcomes reported among nonwhite patients.},

  abstract = {Substantial controversy surrounds the use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria to define chronic kidney disease and assign its stages. We undertook a meta-analysis to assess the independent and combined associations of eGFR and albuminuria with mortality. In this collaborative meta-analysis of general population cohorts, we pooled standardised data for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality from studies containing at least 1000 participants and baseline information about eGFR and urine albumin concentrations. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality associated with eGFR and albuminuria, adjusted for potential confounders. The analysis included 105\hphantom{,}872 participants (730\hphantom{,}577 person-years) from 14 studies with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) measurements and 1\hphantom{,}128\hphantom{,}310 participants (4\hphantom{,}732\hphantom{,}110 person-years) from seven studies with urine protein dipstick measurements. In studies with ACR measurements, risk of mortality was unrelated to eGFR between 75 mL/min/1·73 m2 and 105 mL/min/1·73 m2 and increased at lower eGFRs. Compared with eGFR 95 mL/min/1·73 m2, adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were 1·18 (95\% CI 1·05–1·32) for eGFR 60 mL/min/1·73 m2, 1·57 (1·39–1·78) for 45 mL/min/1·73 m2, and 3·14 (2·39–4·13) for 15 mL/min/1·73 m2. ACR was associated with risk of mortality linearly on the log-log scale without threshold effects. Compared with ACR 0·6 mg/mmol, adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were 1·20 (1·15–1·26) for ACR 1·1 mg/mmol, 1·63 (1·50–1·77) for 3·4 mg/mmol, and 2·22 (1·97–2·51) for 33·9 mg/mmol. eGFR and ACR were multiplicatively associated with risk of mortality without evidence of interaction. Similar findings were recorded for cardiovascular mortality and in studies with dipstick measurements. eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1·73 m2 and ACR 1·1 mg/mmol (10 mg/g) or more are independent predictors of mortality risk in the general population. This study provides quantitative data for use of both kidney measures for risk assessment and definition and staging of chronic kidney disease.

Traditional statistical analysis of 2 surgeons' experiences with resectable malignant melanoma during a 30-year period (November 1970-July 2000) was compared with new tree-structured recursive partitioning regression analysis. Methods. A total of 1018 consecutive patients were registered and 983 patients were evaluable. Disease-free survival (DFS) and melanoma survival (MS) were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method for stage, thickness, ulceration, site, lymph node involvement, age, sex, and type; and compared with log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. Multivariate predictors were used to analyze DFS and MS with a classification and regression tree model that partitioned patients into progressively more homogenous prognostic groups with significantly different Kaplan-Meier curves. Results. Multivariate correlations were with thickness (millimeters), ulceration, age (per year), type, and sex in predicting DFS (relative risk = 1.18, 2.10, 1.05, 1.71, and 1.71, respectively). Thickness, ulceration, age, and type remained significant predictors of MS (relative risk = 1.14, 3.02, 1.02, and 2.30, respectively). Classification and regression tree analysis showed thickness, age, ulceration, and sex affected DFS. Only thickness and ulceration were significant in predicting MS. Conclusion. The Cox model is an important tool for analysis of clinical data but has flaws. New statistical technology to predict outcome should be considered. Classification and regression tree analysis of larger published series may reveal new predictors useful for staging, prognosis, and guiding clinical decisions. Surgery 2002;132:589-604.},

The aim of this study was to characterize a large population-based cohort of adults with asthma, and to study factors associated with all-cause mortality and non-participation in a long-term follow-up.Design: Random and stratified samples from five population-based cohorts were clinically examined during 1986–2001, and all subjects with asthma were included in the study (n = 2055, age 19–72 years, 55\% women). Independent associations between different risk factors and (i) mortality and (ii) non-participation in a clinical follow-up in 2012–2014 were estimated.Results: In 1986–2001, 95\% reported any wheeze and/or attacks of shortness of breath in the past 12 months, and/or asthma medication use. Over the up to 28 years of follow-up time, the cumulative mortality was 22.7\%. Male gender, current smoking, and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 sec of predicted (FEV1\% of predicted) were independent risk factors for mortality, while obesity was associated with non-participation in the follow-up. Older ages, ischemic heart disease, and low socioeconomic status were associated with both mortality and non-participation.Conclusions: The risk factors associated with mortality in this adult population-based asthma cohort were similar to those commonly identified in general population samples, i.e. male gender, current smoking, and lower FEV1\% of predicted, while obesity was associated with non-participation in a long-term follow-up. Ischemic heart disease, low socioeconomic status, and older ages were associated with both mortality and non-participation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overall survival after cancer is frequently used when assessing a health care service's performance as a whole. It is mainly used by the public, politicians and the media, and is often dismissed by clinicians because of the heterogeneous mix of different cancers, risk factors and treatment modalities. Here we give survival details for all cancers combined in Europe, correlating it with economic variables to suggest reasons for differences. METHODS: We computed age and cancer site case-mix standardised relative survival for all cancers combined (ACRS) for 29 countries participating in the EUROCARE-5 project with data on more than 7.5million cancer cases from 87 population-based cancer registries, using complete and period approach. RESULTS: Denmark, United Kingdom (UK) and Eastern European countries had lower survival than neighbouring countries. Five-year ACRS has been increasing throughout Europe, and substantial increases, between 1999-2001 and 2005-2007, have been achieved in countries where survival was lower in the past. Five-year ACRS for men and women are positively correlated with macro-economic variables like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Total National Expenditure on Health (TNEH) (R2 about 70\%). Countries with recent larger increases in GDP and TNEH had greater increases in cancer survival. CONCLUSIONS: ACRS serves to compare all cancer survival in Europe taking account of the geographical variability in case-mixes. The EUROCARE-5 data on ACRS confirm previous EUROCARE findings. Survival appears to correlate with macro-economic determinants, particularly with investments in the health care system.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prognostic factors analysis described in the companion publication (this issue), as well as evidence from the published literature, was used to assemble the tumor-node-metastasis criteria and stage grouping for the melanoma staging system. RESULTS: Major changes include (1) melanoma thickness and ulceration but not level of invasion to be used in the T category (except for T1 melanomas); (2) the number of metastatic lymph nodes rather than their gross dimensions and the delineation of clinically occult (ie, microscopic) versus clinically apparent (ie, macroscopic) nodal metastases to be used in the N category; (3) the site of distant metastases and the presence of elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase to be used in the M category; (4) an upstaging of all patients with stage I, II, and III disease when a primary melanoma is ulcerated; (5) a merging of satellite metastases around a primary melanoma and in-transit metastases into a single staging entity that is grouped into stage III disease; and (6) a new convention for defining clinical and pathologic staging so as to take into account the staging information gained from intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy. CONCLUSION: This revision will become official with publication of the sixth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual in the year 2002.},

  abstract = {Twelve prognostic features of melanoma were examined in a series of 185 patients with nodal metastases (Stage II), who underwent surgical treatment at our institution during the past 20 years. Forty-four per cent of the patients presented with synchronous nodal metastases (substage IIA), 44\% of the patients had delayed nodal metastases (substage IIB), and 12\% of the patients had nodal metastases from an unknown primary site (substage IIC). The patients with IIB (delayed) metastases had a better overall survival rate than patients with IIA (synchronous) metastases, when calculated from the time of diagnosis. These differences could be explained on the basis of tumor burden at the time of initial diagnosis (microscopic for IIB patients versus macroscopic for IIA patients). Once nodal metastases became evident in IIB patients, their survival rates were the same as for substage IIA patients, when calculated from the onset of nodal metastases. The survival rates for both subgroups was 28\% at five years and 15\% for ten years. Substage IIC patients (unknown 1° site) had better five-year survival rates (39\%), but the sample size was small and the differences were not statistically significant. A multifactorial analysis was used to identify the dominant prognostic variables from among 12 clinical and pathologic parameters. Only two factors were found to independently influence survival rates: 1) the number of metastatic nodes (p = 0.005), and the presence or absence of ulceration (p = 0.0019). Additional factors considered that had either indirect or no influence on survival rates (p {$>$} 0.10) were: anatomic location, age, sex, remission duration, substage of disease, tumor thickness, level of invasion, pigmentation, and lymphocyte infiltration. All combinations of nodal metastases were analyzed from survival differences. The combination that showed the greatest differences was one versus two to four versus more than four nodes. Their five-year survival rates were 58\%, 27\% and 10\%, respectively (p {$<$} 0.001). Ulceration of the primary cutaneous melanoma was associated with a {$<$}15\% five-year survival rate, while nonulcerative melanomas had a 30\% five-year survival rate (p {$<$} 0.001). The combination of ulceration and multiple metastatic nodes had a profound adverse effect on survival rates. While tumor thickness was the most important factor in predicting the risk of nodal metastases in Stage I patients (p {$<$} 10-8), it had no predictive value on the patient's clinical course once nodal metastases had occurred (p = 0.507). The number of metastatic nodes and the presence of ulceration are important factors to account for when comparing surgical results, and when analyzing the efficacy of adjunctive systemic treatments.},

Patients and Methods Complete clinicopathologic and follow-up data were available for 2,313 patients with stage III disease in an updated and expanded American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) melanoma staging database. Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate survival analyses were performed.   Results Among all 2,313 patients with stage III disease, 81\% had micrometastases, and 19\% had clinically detectable macrometastases. The 5-year overall survival was 63\%; it was 67\% for patients with nodal micrometastases, and it was 43\% for those with nodal macrometastases (P {$<$} .001). Tremendous heterogeneity in survival was observed, particularly in the microscopically detected nodal metastasis subset (from 23\% to 87\% for 5-year survival). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that in patients with nodal micrometastases, number of tumor-containing lymph nodes, primary tumor thickness, patient age, ulceration, and anatomic site of the primary independently predicted survival (all P {$<$} .01). When added to the model, primary tumor mitotic rate was the second-most powerful predictor of survival after the number of tumor-containing nodes. In contrast, for patients with nodal macrometastases, the number of tumor-containing nodes, primary ulceration, and patient age independently predicted survival (P {$<$} .01).   Conclusion In this multi-institutional analysis, we demonstrated remarkable heterogeneity of prognosis among patients with stage III melanoma, especially among those with nodal micrometastases. These results should be incorporated into the design and interpretation of future clinical trials involving patients with stage III melanoma.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recently proposed major revisions of the tumor-node-metastases (TNM) categories and stage groupings for cutaneous melanoma. Thirteen cancer centers and cancer cooperative groups contributed staging and survival data from a total of 30,450 melanoma patients from their databases in order to validate this staging proposal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 17,600 melanoma patients with complete clinical, pathologic, and follow-up information. Factors predicting melanoma-specific survival rates were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Follow-up survival data for 5 years or longer were available for 73\% of the patients. RESULTS: This analysis demonstrated that (1) in the T category, tumor thickness and ulceration were the most powerful predictors of survival, and the level of invasion had a significant impact only within the subgroup of thin (≤ 1 mm) melanomas; (2) in the N category, the following three independent factors were identified: the number of metastatic nodes, whether nodal metastases were clinically occult or clinically apparent, and the presence or absence of primary tumor ulceration; and (3) in the M category, nonvisceral metastases was associated with a better survival compared with visceral metastases. A marked diversity in the natural history of pathologic stage III melanoma was demonstrated by five-fold differences in 5-year survival rates for defined subgroups. This analysis also demonstrated that large and complex data sets could be used effectively to examine prognosis and survival outcome in melanoma patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this evidence-based methodology were incorporated into the AJCC melanoma staging as described in the companion publication.},

  abstract = {The classification of CLL patients according to the somatic hypermutation status (SHM) of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes, namely mutated (M-CLL) versus unmutated (U-CLL), reflects fundamental differences in disease biology and clinical course. Realizing this, here we followed a compartmentalized approach and addressed the issue of prognostication separately for M-CLL and U-CLL. In a multi-institutional cohort of 2366 patients [M-CLL, n=1364 (58\%); U-CLL, n=1002 (42\%)] consolidated within ERIC, the European Initiative in CLL, we assessed the clinical impact of 'traditional' (age and clinical stage at the time of diagnosis, gender, CD38 expression, FISH detected abnormalities included in the Döhner hierarchical model of cytogenetic aberrations), and novel prognosticators (recurrent mutations within the TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, MYD88, and BIRC3 genes; IGHV gene usage; membership in stereotyped subsets) within M-CLL and U-CLL. Our statistical approach was based both on Cox regression models and recursive partitioning algorithms; internal validation was performed via bootstrapping procedures. Given the retrospective nature of our study, time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) was the primary endpoint. As expected, M-CLL exhibited significantly longer TTFT compared to U-CLL [median TTFT: not yet reached (M-CLL) vs 1.9 years (95\% CI: 0.01-12.3 years, U-CLL), p{$<$}0.0001]. Advanced clinical stages (Binet B-C) were associated with shorter TTFT in both M-CLL and U-CLL; a significantly worse outcome was also identified for Binet C versus Binet B cases (p{$<$}0.0001). Binet A patients received our special focus, representing 90\% and 67\% of M-CLL and U-CLL studied cases, respectively. Amongst Binet A M-CLL cases, TP53 aberrations [TP53abs, deletions of chromosome 17p, del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations], stereotyped subset \#2 membership and trisomy 12 were identified as equally adverse prognostic indicators [median TTFT: 5.5 (95\% CI: 0.2-12.8), 4 (95\% CI: 0.6-6.8) and 7.3 (95\% CI: 0.7-13.4) years, respectively; p-value: non-significant when applying the log-rank test for all paired comparisons); of note, TP53abs were mutually exclusive with the other two features. Amongst Binet A U-CLL cases, TP53abs, SF3B1 mutations and deletion of chromosome 11q [del(11q)] had an overall similar adverse impact [median TTFT for TP53abs, SF3B1 mutations and del(11q): 1.8 (95\% CI: 0.01-4.4), 2 (95\% CI: 0.01-7.7) and 2.1 (95\% CI: 0.01-8.1) years, respectively, p-value: non-significant when applying the log-rank test for all paired comparisons]. Within the remaining Binet A U-CLL cases [i.e. those lacking TP53abs and/or SF3B1 mutations and/or del(11q)], the only parameter associated with shorter TTFT was male gender (median TTFT: 3.5 years, 95\% CI: 0.5-8.1 years). Based on these findings, we developed two prognostic indices for assessing TTFT tailored specifically to M-CLL and U-CLL, respectively. Within M-CLL (Figure 1A), 4 subgroups were identified: (i) very high risk: Binet C with identical 5- and 10-year treatment-probability (TP) of 92\%; (ii) high risk: Binet B, 5y-TP and 10y-TP: 64\% and 84\%, respectively; (iii) intermediate risk: Binet A with one of the following: TP53abs or +12 or subset \#2 membership, 5y-TP and 10y-TP: 40\% and 55\%, respectively; and (iv) low risk: Binet A nonTP53abs/+12/subset\#2, 5y-TP and 10y-TP: 12\% and 25\%, respectively. Within U-CLL (Figure 1B), 5 subgroups were identified: (i) very high risk: Binet C with 5- and 10-year TP of 100\%; (ii) high risk: Binet B, identical 5y-TP and 10y-TP: 90\% and 100\%, respectively; (iii) intermediate risk: Binet A with one of the following: TP53abs or SF3B1 mutations or del(11q), 5y-TP and 10y-TP: 78\% and 98\%, respectively; (v) low risk: Binet A, male nonTP53abs/SF3B1mut/del(11q), 5y-TP and 10y-TP: 65\% and 85\%, respectively and (iv) very low risk: Binet A, female nonTP53abs/SF3B1mut/del(11q), 5y-TP and 10y-TP: 45\% and 65\%, respectively. In conclusion, we identified clinicobiological parameters with distinct prognostic implications for M-CLL and U-CLL. These parameters were used in order to develop prognostic indices tailored to SHM status that were found capable of distinguishing subgroups with markedly different outcomes. We argue that such a compartmentalized approach may supersede previous attempts, thus overcoming the pronounced heterogeneity of CLL and optimizing prognostication.

  abstract = {Research on the impact of obesity on ovarian cancer survival is inconsistent but previous studies did not consider the possible impact of ascites, bowel obstruction, or cachexia, which commonly occur in late-stage disease. We evaluated this association in a cohort study of primary invasive epithelial ovarian cancers diagnosed from 2000-2013 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) (n=1,157). Deaths were identified through December 2014, with median follow-up of 37 months. Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate overall and ovarian cancer-specific mortality, accounting for prognostic variables including age at diagnosis, race, stage, grade, histology, comorbidities, treatment, post-treatment CA125 levels, ascites, and bowel obstruction. There was no evidence of an association between BMI and overall or ovarian cancer-specific survival. However, we found strong effect modification by stage (Pinteraction{$<$}.01). Compared to normal pre-diagnosis BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), for women who were obese before diagnosis (BMI≥35 kg/m2) risk of ovarian cancer-specific mortality was increased among those diagnosed at stages I/II (Hazard ratio [HR]: 3.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-9.99), but reduced among those diagnosed with stage IV disease (HR: 0.58; 95\%CI: 0.35-0.96). Associations persisted after excluding those diagnosed with cachexia (n=91) and further adjusting for ascites and bowel obstruction, with no evidence of effect modification by these factors. Associations of obesity with ovarian cancer survival differ by stage, with decreased survival among those with localized disease and increased survival among those with late-stage disease. Stage-specific effects of obesity on survival suggest a tailored approach to improve prognosis may be appropriate. Citation Format: Elisa V.

However, previous studies have reported conflicting results and no data exist to explain the underlying cause of higher death rates in these patients. Methods and Results All patients with first acute MI between 1997 and 2009 in Denmark, without prior AF, were identified from Danish nationwide administrative registers. The impact of new‐onset AF on all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular death, fatal/nonfatal stroke, fatal/nonfatal re‐infarction and noncardiovascular death, were analyzed by multiple time‐dependent Cox models and additionally in propensity score matched analysis. In 89 703 patients with an average follow‐up of 5.0±3.5 years event rates were higher in patients developing AF (n=10 708) versus those staying in sinus‐rhythm (n=78 992): all‐cause mortality 173.9 versus 69.4 per 1000 person‐years, cardiovascular death 137.2 versus 50.0 per 1000 person‐years, fatal/nonfatal stroke 19.6/19.9 versus 6.2/5.6 per 1000 person‐years, fatal/nonfatal re‐infarction 29.0/60.7 versus 14.2/37.9 per 1000 person‐years. In time‐dependent multiple Cox analyses, new‐onset AF remained predictive of increased all‐cause mortality (HR: 1.9 [95\% CI: 1.8 to 2.0]), cardiovascular death (HR: 2.1 [2.0 to 2.2]), fatal/nonfatal stroke (HR: 2.3 [2.1 to 2.6]/HR: 2.5 [2.2 to 2.7]), fatal/nonfatal re‐infarction (HR: 1.7 [1.6 to 1.8]/HR: 1.8 [1.7 to 1.9]), and non‐ cardiovascular death (HR: 1.4 [1.3 to 1.5]) all P{$<$}0.001). Propensity‐score matched analyses yielded nearly identical results (all P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions New‐onset AF after first‐time MI is associated with increased mortality, which is largely explained by more cardiovascular deaths. Focus on the prognostic impact of post‐infarct AF is warranted.},

Statins have anti-inflammatory properties and we aimed to evaluate the association between the use of statins and the risk of death, progression of CP, and pancreatic cancer in patients with CP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a nested case-cohort study and included patients with CP. We used claims of proton pump inhibitors as an active comparator. Patients with cirrhosis or cancer were excluded. We evaluated the exposure on the basis of pharmacy claims of statins. We used propensity score matching with a statins\,:\,nonstatins ratio of 1\,:\,1. RESULTS: A total of 4807 patients were eligible for propensity score matching; 33\% were women and the mean (SD) age at cohort entry was 56 (10) years. During follow-up, a total of 2073 (43\%) patients had died and the risk of death was significantly lower among patients using statins versus no statins among 678 matched patients [hazard ratio (HR) 0.64; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.83]. Use of statins versus no statins was associated with decreased progression of CP, with an HR of 0.21 (95\% CI: 0.17-0.26). Pancreatic cancer occurred in 117 (2.4\%) patients and we found a lower risk of pancreatic cancer in statin-treated patients compared with no statins, with a HR of 0.21 (95\% CI: 0.06-0.70). CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study, we found lower risks of mortality, disease progression, and pancreatic cancer in patients with CP using statins. The study is limited by its retrospective design, but supports the hypothesis that statins may affect the course of CP.},

In the past 15 years, the novel treatment strategy in subgroups of symptomatic patients with AS have been the subject of extensive research, starting from introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) in inoperable symptomatic patients with severe AS and continuing further to patients with very high and high operative risk. In the past few years, the focus has further shifted toward the patients with lower operative risk, as well as to asymptomatic patients with severe AS. In the former group, the question relates to whether TAVI is beneficial when compared to SAVR in intermediate- to low-risk patients with symptomatic AS. In the latter group, the main issue is if and when the SAVR should be performed.

Using time-updated laboratory measurements, we use several methods to derive a score that can be used to identify individuals at high risk of mortality.         Methods:~Patients who started highly active antiretroviral therapy after 2000 and had ≥1 CD4 count, viral load, and laboratory marker recorded after the date of starting highly active antiretroviral therapy were included in the analyses. Laboratory markers were stratified into quintiles and associations between each marker and mortality was assessed using Poisson regression. The estimates of the final model were used to construct a score for predicting short-term mortality. Several methods, including multiple imputation, were used for analyzing records with missing measurements.         Results:~Of the 7232 patients included in this analysis, 247 died over 24,796 person-years of follow-up, giving an overall mortality rate of 1.00 (95\% confidence interval: 0.87 to 1.12) per 100 person-years. Regardless of which method was used to deal with missing data, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and hemoglobin were independently associated with mortality. Alanine transaminase was independently associated with mortality when patients with missing measurements were assumed to have measurements within the normal range. The C-statistics for all models ranged from 0.76 to 0.78.         Conclusion~Measures of alanine transaminase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and hemoglobin in the normal range were predictive of mortality, and hence we suggest using a scoring system to predict mortality which relies on the raw values of these 4 laboratory markers.},

BACKGROUND: DCM is a myocardial disease, characterized by left and/or right ventricular dilation and dysfunction and poor outcome. Evidence-based treatment with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and, in the last decade, implantable cardioverter defibrillators have been demonstrated to improve significantly heart failure symptoms and prognosis. At present, DCM patients are unlikely to be accepted for life insurance. METHODS: A cohort of 577 DCM patients consecutively enrolled from 1988 to 2004 in the Heart Muscle Disease Registry of Trieste, Italy, was matched by sex, age and registry data entry with the mortality data of the Italian population. Relative survival has been estimated by means of Kaplan-Meier technique, and mortality ratios (MR) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals have been computed. RESULTS: DCM patients who showed a significant reverse remodelling within the first 2 years of treatment showed comparable survival with respect to the control population, and therefore could be taken into consideration for life insurance coverage, at least for a short or medium-term of years. CONCLUSIONS: The data illustrate that survival probability strongly depend on the individual treatment and evolution of the disease and could be easily measured within the first 2 years of follow-up. If this information is collected at the time of evaluation of an applicant for life cover, the insurance company could possibly improve its risk stratification.},

Although there are numerous data on patient and graft survival after liver transplantation, life expectancy and possible loss of life (compared with a normal matched population) in those who survive remains unknown. Aims: To assess the life expectancy and life years lost of adult liver allograft recipients, compared with an age and sex matched UK population to provide patients with more information and to improve the use of a scarce resource. Methods: Using the National Transplant Database held by UK Transplant, on over 3600 adult liver allograft recipients transplanted between 1985 and 2003, we analysed survival of all adults who survived more than six months after transplantation and compared survival after transplantation with national age and sex matched controls to assess life years lost. Results: Estimated median survival time of the analysis cohort of 2702 adult liver allograft recipients was 22.2 years (95\% confidence interval 19.3–25.6), with an estimated loss of seven life years compared with an age and sex matched population. Conclusions: Overall, female recipients have a longer life expectancy and lose fewer life years than male recipients.

Follow-up periods have been short in these studies; therefore, the present investigation examined this phenomenon over an extended period of time. Patients with established CAD (n = 1,250) were assessed for depression with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and followed for subsequent mortality. Follow-up ranged up to 19.4 years. SDS scores were associated with increased risk of subsequent cardiac death (p = 0.002) and total mortality (p {$<$}0.001) after controlling for initial disease severity and treatment. Patients with moderate to severe depression had a 69\% greater odds of cardiac death and a 78\% greater odds of mortality from all causes than nondepressed patients. Increased risk was not confined to the initial months after hospitalization. Patients with high SDS scores at baseline still had a higher risk of cardiac death {$>$}5 years later (p {$<$}0.005). Compared with the nondepressed, patients with moderate to severe depression had an 84\% greater risk 5 to 10 years later and a 72\% greater risk after {$>$} 10 years. Patients with mild depression had intermediate levels of risk in all models. The heightened long-term risk of depressed patients suggests that depression may be persistent or frequently recurrent in CAD patients and is associated with CAD progression, triggering of acute events, or both.},

For the analyses we combined the 1972 and 1977 cohorts (cohort 1), the 1982 and 1987 cohorts (cohort 2) and similarly also the 1992 and 1997 cohorts (cohort 3).RESULTSAge-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality and CVD in men without diabetes showed that both had a statistically significant decreased risk of all-cause mortality compared to the first cohort. No statistically significant changes in all-cause mortality were observed in men and women with diabetes between the latter two cohorts compared with the first after controlling for several covariates. In both men and women without diabetes, cohort 2 (men, HR=0.65; 95\% CI 0.51-0.82; women, HR=0.54; 95\% CI 0.32-0.89) and cohort 3 (men, HR=0.32; 95\% CI 0.22-0.47; women, HR=0.31; 95\% CI 0.14-0.68) showed a statistically significant decreased risk of CVD mortality compared to cohort 1. Age-adjusted HRs in regard to CVD mortality in men (HR=0.22; 95\% CI 0.07-0.69) and women (HR=0.22; 95\% CI 0.05-0.99) with diabetes of cohort 3 were statistically significantly lower than in cohort 1.CONCLUSIONSThere seems to be a decrease in CVD mortality in people with diabetes indicating that treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors in diabetes patients may have improved during the last decade.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND It has previously been shown that the increased use of therapeutic intervention may not reduce patient fatality if there is a simultaneous increase in case severity. The present study was designed to extend the relationship between case severity and therapeutic interventions to long-term survival in the same study population. OBJECTIVE To compare five-year survival of patients discharged after acute myocardial infarction from 1984 to 1988 and from 1989 to 1993, and to evaluate possible reasons for survival differences. METHODS The present study was population-based. Survival time was determined by record linkage into the Canadian Mortality Database. Association of five-year survival with patient characteristics, in-hospital treatment and discharge medications was assessed by logistical regression analysis. Case severity was calculated as the probability of death within five years, given the patient profile and excluding any interventions. RESULTS Between the two study periods, most patient characteristics and treatment intensity changed, but case severity for the study population remained constant. Five-year survival improved from 74.8\% to 79.2\% (Pχ2 =0.001). The improvement was adequately described by the combination of changes in patient profile and treatment without residual period effect (Pgoodness-of-fit=0.752). The treatments significantly associated with five-year survival were coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OR 2.74; 95\% CI 1.86 to 4.05), percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 2.63; 95\% CI 1.67 to 4.14) and thrombolysis (OR 1.98; 95\% CI 1.50 to 2.62) during admission, as well as acetylsalicylic acid (OR 1.39; 95\% CI 1.15 to 1.68) or beta-blocker (OR 1.60; 95\% CI 1.34 to 1.92) prescription at discharge. CONCLUSIONS Changes in patient profile did not affect long-term prognosis; instead, treatment modalities accounted for the observed improvement in five-year survival.},

At diagnosis, clinical and socio-demographic data were recorded and lifestyle habits were assessed through a validated questionnaire. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Cox regression.Results: The mean follow-up was 6.6 years (standard deviation (SD) 4.3). The mean survival time was 7.56 years (SD 0.155). At both univariate and multivariate analysis heavy cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking were associated with poor survival. Compared with those with a lower cumulative exposure to tobacco smoking, those who had smoked \&gt;31 pack-years had a worse survival (HR = 1.60, 95\%CI = 1.18–2.18). Drinkers had a higher risk of death compared with non-drinkers (HR = 1.41, 95\%CI = 1.10–1.81). Considering only those who had NHL as cause of death, the HR for the higher category of pack-years smoked, compared with the lowest, was 1.63 (95\% CI = 1.15–2.33) and for drinkers, compared with non-drinkers, it was 1.33 (95\% CI = 1.01–1.80).Conclusions: cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking may influence NHL survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in sarcoidosis. We established a multi-national registry of sarcoidosis associated PH (SAPH) patients. METHODS: Sarcoidosis patients with PH confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC) were studied. Patients with pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) of 15 mmHg or less and a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 Hg were subsequently analyzed. Data collected included hemodynamics, forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), chest x-ray, and 6-min walk distance (6MWD). RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were analyzed. This included 84 (48\%) cases identified within a year of entry into the registry and 94 (53\%) with moderate to severe PH. There was a significant correlation between DLCO percent predicted (\% pred) andmPAP (Rho = -0.228, p = 0.0068) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (Rho = -0.362, p {$<$} 0.0001). PVR was significantly higher in stage 4 disease than in stage 0 or 1 disease (p {$<$} 0.05 for both comparisons). About two-thirds of the SAPH patients came from the United States (US). There was a significant difference in the rate of treatment between US (67.5\%) versus non-US (86\%) (Chi Square 11.26, p = 0.0008) sites. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of SAPH were similar across multiple centers in the US, Europe, and the Middle East. The severity of SAPH was related to reduced DLCO. There were treatment differences between the US and non-US centers.},

Sarcoidosis-associated PH may be the result of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) or isolated pulmonary vasculature abnormality. Our objective was to determine if the cause of PH affects survival in patients with sarcoidosis with persistent dyspnea. METHODS: Patients with sarcoidosis with persistent dyspnea despite immunosuppressive therapy underwent right-sided heart catheterization. Patients with a pulmonary artery occluding pressure (PAO) ≥ 15 mm Hg were defined as having LVD. Patients were classified based on hemodynamics as no PH (pulmonary artery mean pressure [PAmean] {$<$} 25 mm Hg), PH without LVD (PAmean ≥ 25 mm Hg and PAO {$<$} 15 mm Hg), and PH with LVD (PH/LVD) (PAmean ≥ 25 mm Hg and PAO ≥ 15 mm Hg). RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were studied at one institution: 50 (38.5\%) patients had PH without LVD, whereas 20 (15.4\%) had PH/LVD. All patients had their diagnostic procedure at least 18 months prior to analysis. The hazard ratio (HR) for death in PH without LVD vs no PH was 10.39 (95\% CI, 2.99-13.78; P {$<$} .0001). The HR for dying for PH without LVD vs PH/LVD was 3.14 (95\% CI, 1.01-5.62; P {$<$} .05). The presence of stage 4 chest roentgenograms and the need for supplemental oxygen were different between the groups. In a Cox proportional hazards model, independent predictors for survival were stage 4 chest roentgenogram (P {$<$} .005) and hemodynamic group (P {$<$} .02). CONCLUSION: PH without LVD was associated with increased mortality. Proper characterization of patients required hemodynamic evaluation, as 29\% of sarcoidosis-associated PH was due to LVD.},

No biological differences (cytogenetics by fluorescent in situ hybridization, IGHV, ZAP-70, CD38, NOTCH1, SF3B1) were found across age groups. Elderly patients ({$>$}70 years; n=367) presented more frequently with advanced disease (Binet C/Rai III-IV: 10/12\% vs. 5/5\%; p{$<$}.001), were treated less frequently (23.8\% vs. 41.9\% at 3 years; p{$<$}.001) and in most cases received no highly effective regimens thereby achieving a lower overall response rate (49\% with 14\% complete response vs. 69\%with 31\% complete response; p{$<$}.001). They also had shorter overall survival (6.6 vs. 13.3 years; p{$<$}.001) and higher disease-unrelated mortality (34.9\% vs. 6.9\% at 10 years; p{$<$}.001). However, disease-attributable mortality was not significantly different between both groups. Combining Binet stage, ZAP-70, beta2-microglobulin and comorbidity two risk groups (low-risk: 0-1 parameters; high-risk: 2-4 parameters) with different overall survival (median: 6.8 vs. 11.4 years, p{$<$}.001) were identified. In patients requiring treatment, comorbidity at treatment (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-T{$>$}4; hazard ratio 2.2, p{$<$}001) and response (Failure vs. Response: hazard ratio 1.60, p{$<$}.04) were the most important prognostic factors for overall survival. In conclusion, in our series elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with no distinct biological features as compared to younger ones and had a poorer clinical outcome.

Age- and sex-specific prevalence, incidence rates, mortality rates and standardised mortality ratios relative to the non-diabetic part of the population were calculated.The register contains records for about 360,000 persons with diabetes; 230,000 were alive at 1 January 2007, corresponding to an overall prevalence of 4.2\%. The prevalence increased by 6\% per year. In 2004 the incidence rates were 1.8 per 100,000 at age 40 years and 10.0 per 100,000 at age 70 years. The incidence rate increased 5\% per year before 2004 and then stabilised. The mortality rate in the diabetic population decreased 4\% per year, compared with 2\% per year in the non-diabetic part of the population. The mortality rate decreased 40\% during the first 3 years after inclusion in the register. The standardised mortality ratio decreased with age, from 4.0 at age 50 years to 2.5 at age 70 years and just under 2 at age 85 years, identically for men and women. The standardised mortality ratio decreased 1\% per calendar year. The lifetime risk of diabetes was 30\%.The prevalence of diabetes in Denmark rose in 1995-2006, but the mortality rate in diabetic patients decreased faster than that of the non-diabetic population. The mortality rate decreased markedly just after inclusion in the register. Incidence rates have shown a tendency to decrease during the last few years, but this finding should be viewed with caution.},

  abstract = {Background Alcoholic liver disease has emerged as a leading indication for hepatic transplantation, although it is a controversial use of resources. We aimed to examine all aspects of liver transplantation associated with alcohol abuse. Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of 123 alcoholic patients with a median of 7 years follow-up at one center. Results In addition to alcohol, 43 (35\%) patients had another possible factor contributing to cirrhosis. Actuarial patient and graft survival rates were, respectively, 84\% and 81\% (1 year); 72\% and 66\% (5 years); and 63\% and 59\% (7 years). After transplantation, 18 patients (15\%) manifested 21 noncutaneous de novo malignancies, which is significantly more than controls (P=0.0001); upper aerodigestive squamous carcinomas were overrepresented (P=0.03). Thirteen patients had definitely relapsed and three others were suspected to have relapsed. Relapse was predicted by daily ethanol consumption (P=0.0314), but not by duration of pretransplant sobriety or explant histology. No patient had alcoholic hepatitis after transplantation and neither late onset acute nor chronic rejection was significantly increased. Multiple regression analyses for predictors of graft failure identified major biliary/vascular complications (P=0.01), chronic bile duct injury on biopsy (P=0.002), and pericellular fibrosis on biopsy (P=0.05); graft viral hepatitis was marginally significant (P=0.07) on univariate analysis. Conclusions Alcoholic liver disease is an excellent indication for liver transplantation in those without coexistent conditions. Recurrent alcoholic liver disease alone is not an important cause of graft pathology or failure. Potential recipients should be heavily screened before transplantation for coexistent conditions (e.g., hepatitis C, metabolic diseases) and other target-organ damage, especially aerodigestive malignancy, which are greater causes of morbidity and mortality than is recurrent alcohol liver disease.},

No previous study has ever reported cause specific mortality. We report on the mortality of a cohort of 220 parkinsonian patients recruited between 1970 and 1972 from 40 primary health care practices all over England and Wales and matched to 421 controls. At 20 years of follow up, 195 cases (88.6\%) and 295 controls (70.1\%) were no longer alive (P {$<$} 0.001). The median age at death for cases was 77.6 (range 53.8-97.3) and 83.5 (range 55.0-100.1) for controls (P {$<$} 0.001). The all cause hazard ratio for cases compared with controls was 2.6 (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 2.2-3.2) controlling for age, sex, and geographical region. There was little difference between men and women. Differences for cause specific mortality also emerged. Both ischemic heart disease (2.3, 95\% CI 1.5-3.4) and cerebrovascular disease (3.6, 95\% CI 2.2-6.1) showed significantly increased hazard ratios. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed in terms of (a) competing causes of death, (b) a secondary effect of drug treatment, and (c) common aetiological factors for both parkinsonism and cardiovascular disease.},

Consistently, the cumulative probability of 10-year mortality was significantly higher among patients with a nonischemic versus ischemic precipitant (83\% vs 90\%, respectively; Log-rank P value {$<$}0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that among the nonischemic precipitant, the presence of renal dysfunction and infection were both associated with poor short-term outcomes (OR 1.56, [P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001] and OR 1.35 [P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001], respectively), as well as long-term (HR 1.59 [P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001] and HR 1.24 [P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001], respectively)., Identification of precipitating factors for acute HF hospitalization has important short- and long-term implications that can be used for improved risk stratification and management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A high body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, but the precise relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality remains uncertain. METHODS: We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for an association between BMI and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, study, physical activity, alcohol consumption, education, and marital status in pooled data from 19 prospective studies encompassing 1.46 million white adults, 19 to 84 years of age (median, 58). RESULTS: The median baseline BMI was 26.2. During a median follow-up period of 10 years (range, 5 to 28), 160,087 deaths were identified. Among healthy participants who never smoked, there was a J-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality. With a BMI of 22.5 to 24.9 as the reference category, hazard ratios among women were 1.47 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 1.62) for a BMI of 15.0 to 18.4; 1.14 (95\% CI, 1.07 to 1.22) for a BMI of 18.5 to 19.9; 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.96 to 1.04) for a BMI of 20.0 to 22.4; 1.13 (95\% CI, 1.09 to 1.17) for a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9; 1.44 (95\% CI, 1.38 to 1.50) for a BMI of 30.0 to 34.9; 1.88 (95\% CI, 1.77 to 2.00) for a BMI of 35.0 to 39.9; and 2.51 (95\% CI, 2.30 to 2.73) for a BMI of 40.0 to 49.9. In general, the hazard ratios for the men were similar. Hazard ratios for a BMI below 20.0 were attenuated with longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In white adults, overweight and obesity (and possibly underweight) are associated with increased all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality is generally lowest with a BMI of 20.0 to 24.9.},

Both cohorts were Child-Pugh class A and had advanced (stage 3) fibrosis or cirrhosis (stage 4) confirmed by liver biopsy at enrolment., In the NAFLD cohort, followed-up for 85.6 months mean (range 6-297), there were 48 (19.4\%) liver-related complications and 33 (13.4\%) deaths or liver transplants. In the HCV cohort, followed-up for 74.9 months mean (range 6-238), there were 47 (16.7\%) liver-related complications and 25 (9.4\%) deaths or liver transplants. When adjusting for baseline differences in age and gender, the cumulative incidence of liver-related complications was lower in the NAFLD than the HCV cohort (p=0.03), including incident hepatocellular cancer (6 vs 18; p=0.03), but that of cardiovascular events (p=0.17) and overall mortality (p=0.6) was similar in both groups.

  abstract = {Summary High body-mass index (BMI) predisposes to several site-specific cancers, but a large-scale systematic and detailed characterisation of patterns of risk across all common cancers adjusted for potential confounders has not previously been undertaken. We aimed to investigate the links between BMI and the most common site-specific cancers. With primary care data from individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with BMI data, we fitted Cox models to investigate associations between BMI and 22 of the most common cancers, adjusting for potential confounders. We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated population effects. 5·24 million individuals were included; 166\hphantom{,}955 developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers, but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus (hazard ratio [HR] 1·62, 99\% CI 1·56–1·69; p{$<$}0·0001), gallbladder (1·31, 1·12–1·52; p{$<$}0·0001), kidney (1·25, 1·17–1·33; p{$<$}0·0001), cervix (1·10, 1·03–1·17; p=0·00035), thyroid (1·09, 1·00–1·19; p=0·0088), and leukaemia (1·09, 1·05–1·13; p≤0·0001). BMI was positively associated with liver (1·19, 1·12–1·27), colon (1·10, 1·07–1·13), ovarian (1·09, 1.04–1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1·05, 1·03–1·07) overall (all p{$<$}0·0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0·98, 0·95–1·00; premenopausal breast cancer 0·89, 0·86–0·92) and in never-smokers (prostate 0·96, 0·93–0·99; premenopausal breast cancer 0·89, 0·85–0·94). By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association in never smokers (lung 0·99, 0·93–1·05; oral cavity 1·07, 0·91–1·26): inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers, probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming causality, 41\% of uterine and 10\% or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m2 population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI. BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects. The heterogeneity in the effects suggests that different mechanisms are associated with different cancer sites and different patient subgroups.

This review presents data from nationally representative datasets to provide up-to-date statistics on mortality, prevalence, treatment and costs. Data focus on CVD as a whole, coronary heart disease (International Classification of Diseases (ICD):I20–25) and cerebrovascular disease (ICD:I60–69); however, where available, other cardiovascular conditions are also presented. In 2012, CVD was the most common cause of death in the UK for women (28\% of all female deaths), but not for men, where cancer is now the most common cause of death (32\% of all male deaths). Mortality from CVD varies widely throughout the UK, with the highest age-standardised CVD death rates in Scotland (347/100 000) and the North of England (320/100 000 in the North West). Prevalence of coronary heart disease is also highest in the North of England (4.5\% in the North East) and Scotland (4.3\%). Overall, around three times as many men have had a myocardial infarction compared with women. Treatment for CVD is increasing over time, with prescriptions and operations for CVD having substantially increased over the last two decades. The National Health Service in England spent around £6.8 billion on CVD in 2012/2013, the majority of which came from spending on secondary care. Despite significant declines in mortality in the UK, CVD remains a considerable burden, both in terms of health and costs. Both primary and secondary prevention measures are necessary to reduce both the burden of CVD and inequalities in CVD mortality and prevalence.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Objective Endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus (BO) provides an opportunity to detect early stage oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). We sought to determine the proportion of OAC patients with a prior diagnosis of BO on a population basis and to evaluate the influence of a prior diagnosis of BO on survival, taking into account lead and length time biases. Design A retrospective population-based study of all OAC patients in Northern Ireland between 2003 and 2008. A prior BO diagnosis was determined by linkage to the Northern Ireland BO register. Stage distribution at diagnosis and histological grade were compared between patients with and without a prior BO diagnosis. Overall survival, using Cox models, was compared between patients with and without a prior BO diagnosis. The effect of adjusting the survival differences for histological grade and estimates of lead and length time bias was assessed. Results There were 716 OAC cases, 52 (7.3\%) of whom had a prior BO diagnosis. Patients with a prior BO diagnosis had significantly lower tumour stage (44.2\% vs 11.1\% had stage 1 or 2 disease; p{$<$}0.001), a higher rate of surgical resection (50.0\% vs 25.5\%; p{$<$}0.001) and had a higher proportion of low/intermediate grade tumours (46.2\% vs 26.5\%; p=0.011). A prior BO diagnosis was associated with significantly better survival (HR for death 0.39; 95\% CI 0.27 to 0.58), which was minimally influenced by adjustment for age, sex and tumour grade (adjusted HR 0.44; 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.64). Correction for lead time bias attenuated but did not abolish the survival benefit (HR 0.65; 95\% CI 0.45 to 0.95) and further adjustment for length time bias had little effect. Conclusions The proportion of OAC patients with a prior diagnosis of BO is low; however, prior identification of BO is associated with an improvement in survival in OAC patients.},

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we find that the incremental healthcare costs associated with obesity are passed on to obese workers with employer-sponsored health insurance in the form of lower cash wages. Obese workers without employer-sponsored insurance do not have a wage offset relative to their non-obese counterparts. A substantial part of the lower wages among obese women attributed to labor market discrimination can be explained by their higher health insurance premiums},

  abstract = {Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism are frequently observed in cirrhosis, and approximately 15\% to 30\% of patients have overt diabetes. In a retrospective and prospective study in cirrhosis, we analyzed the prognostic significance of diabetes, which was defined as the presence of hyperglycemia and overt glycosuria that in most cases required dietary restrictions or active treatment. The clinical records of all patients with cirrhosis admitted to our department for the period 1980 to 1985 were reviewed in 1985 and 1986, and surviving patients were prospectively followed up until December 1991. Final status could be obtained in 354 (98 with diabetes) of 382 eligible patients; 110 were alive at the end of follow-up. Prognostic factors were identified by Kaplan-Meier analysis, followed by Cox's stepwise regression. The model identified, in sequence, albumin, ascites, age, encephalopathy, bilirubin, diabetes, and platelets as prognostic factors. The larger mortality rate in patients with diabetes was not due to complications of diabetes but to an increased risk of hepatocellular failure. Diabetes was no longer a risk factor as a covariate in a subgroup of 271 patients when varices were added but was again significant when patients who died of gastrointestinal bleeding were excluded. The presence of diabetes, clinically detectable and often requiring adequate treatment, is a risk factor for long-term survival in cirrhosis.},

A single institution retrospective analysis of 154 type II EC cases from 1987 to 2010 was conducted. Patients were categorized into cohorts by BMI (normal ({$<$}25), overweight (25–29.9), obese class I (30–34.9), and obese class IIIII (≥35)). Descriptive, regression and ANOVA analyses were performed. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared with log rank tests. The BMI distribution was 22.8\% normal BMI; 24\% overweight; 17.5\% class I; and 35.7\% class IIIII. The median follow up was 41months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 45.4, 36.0, 35.3 and 42.0months and overall survival (OS) was 54.7, 44.7, 44.8 and 49.7months, among the respective groups. There was no association between BMI and PFS (p=0.71), OS (p=0.72), or time to recurrence (p=0.71). There were no differences among the increasing BMI groups compared to normal weight women for the risk of death. Our analysis did not reveal any differences in outcomes by BMI group. Our data reveals that obesity is highly prevalent in type II ECs, though obesity has not historically been described as a risk factor. While BMI as a single variable may not be prognostic for survival outcomes, the role of obesity as a risk factor for type II EC should be further investigated, given the increasing prevalence of obesity in type II ECs.},

  abstract = {Survivals of two series of CLL patients (99 from a retrospective series and 196 from a prospective series) were studied separately. The three main staging systems (Rai, Binet, Rundles) agreed well, but as far as survival is concerned, too many stages are defined. The authors performed a Cox multivariate analysis of survival in order to isolate important prognostic factors at diagnosis and to use them to build a simple three-stage classification. Thrombopenia and anemia appeared as the most important risk factors. Among the nonanemic and nonthrombopenic patients, the number of involved areas was clearly related to prognosis in the authors' two series. This study allowed the authors to propose a new classification in three prognostic groups. Group C: anemia (Hb {$<$} 10 g) and/or thrombopenia (platelets {$<$} 100,000/mm3); about 15\% of the patients; median of 2 years. Group B: no anemia, no thrombopenia, three or more involved areas (counting as one each of the following: axillary, cervical, inguinal, lymph nodes, whether unilateral or bilateral, spleen and liver); about 30\% of patients; median of 7 years. Group A: no anemia, no thrombopenia, less than three involved areas; about 55\% of patients; the survival of this group does not seem different from that of the French population of the same age and sex distribution. This three-stage classification only requires clinical examination and routine hemogram, has a good prognostic value which was confirmed on the series of Montserrat and Rozman (146 patients), and should therefore be helpful in planning new clinical trials.},

METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted using existing dataset. Deaths due to diabetes, as underlying cause of death, from 1907 to 1998 were tallied, according to the ICD-9. Trends in diabetes mortality (overall population, under-19 and over 40-year-old age groups) by gender were examined. RESULTS: There was a slightly increasing trend in the mortality rate in males over the study period, from 14.38/100,000 in 1907 to 16.05/100,000 in 1998. Among females, it started from 19.6/100,000 in 1907, reached the peak in early 1940s and then decreased to 10.61/100,000 in 1998. There was a reversal sex ratio after late 1960s with mortality rates among males were higher than females after 1969. There was a significant difference in overall mortality between males and females over study period (p{$<$}0.001). The mortality trend among the 40 years and over group was similar to the overall population. The death rates for the under-19 group declined significantly over the study period (p{$<$}0.001), but no difference between males and females was detected (p{$>$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of insulin played an important role in the reduction of diabetes mortality among the under-19-year-old group. New medical treatment methods to reduce chronic complications and other public health interventions could have made a recent contribution to reducing death rates. It is also probable that over the study period there has been an increase in the likelihood of diabetes being correctly diagnosed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) is a leading indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). GOALS: To investigate the long-term outcome of OLT for ALC compared with patients transplanted for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. STUDY: From 1987 to 2001, 49 OLT were performed for ALC and 173 for HCV. From these contemporary groups we matched 1:2 ALC patients (cases) to 98 HCV (controls). The following variables were analyzed: survival, retransplantation, rejection, primary nonfunction, infections, de novo tumors, cardiovascular and neurologic complications, and alcoholic recurrence. RESULTS: Actuarial survival rate at 9 years was comparable for cases and controls. Actuarial graft survival rate at 9 years was significantly higher in cases (78\% vs. 60\%; P=0.026). The retransplantation rate was higher in controls (21\% vs. 4\%; P=0.007). Post-OLT complications were not significantly different. The alcoholic recidivism rate was 28\% without influence on patients or graft survival, whereas relapse of HCV caused the majority of death in controls (30\%; P=0.042). At multivariate analysis retransplantation was the only predictor of patient survival (odds ratio: 4.35; 95\% confidence interval: 2.16-8.74; P{$<$}0.001), whereas HCV was associated with a 2-fold probability of graft failure (odds ratio: 1.97; 95\% confidence interval: 1.02-3.81; P=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term outcome of OLT for ALC is comparable to that for HCV, even if graft survival is significantly better among ALC. These data support ALC as an excellent indication for OLT.},

  abstract = {Aim We conducted a matched-cohort study to assess mortality in schizophrenia and the relationship of mortality with comorbid somatic conditions and suicide attempts. Method A full-population register-based prospective matched-cohort study was performed including all eligible patients with schizophrenia in Hungary between 01/01/2005 and 31/12/2013. Control subjects were individually matched to patients with schizophrenia at a 5:1 ratio. The principal outcome measure was death due to any reason. A non-parametric approach was used for descriptive statistical purposes, the Kaplan-Meier model for survival analysis, and the Cox proportional-hazards regression model for inferential statistics. Results Patients with schizophrenia (n = 65,169) had substantially higher risk of all-cause mortality than the control subjects (n = 325,435) (RR = 2.4; P \&lt; 0.0001). Comorbidities and suicide attempts were associated with significantly increased mortality in both groups. As compared to the controls, 20-year old males with schizophrenia had a shorter life expectancy by 11.5 years, and females by 13.7 years; the analogous numbers for 45-year old schizophrenics were 8.1 and 9.6 years, respectively. Conclusions A significant mortality gap~–~mainly associated with somatic comorbidities~–~was detected between patients with schizophrenia and individually matched controls. Improved medical training to address the disparity in mortality, and many other factors including lack of resources, access to and model of medical care, lifestyle, medication side effects, smoking, stigma, need for early intervention and adequate health care organization could help to better address the physical health needs of patients with schizophrenia.},

Approximately 290,000 women from Austria, Norway, and Sweden were enrolled during 1974–2005, with measurements of height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and circulating levels of glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Relative risks were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The metabolic syndrome was assessed as a composite z score, as the standardized sum of z scores for body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. A total of 917 endometrial carcinomas and 129 fatal cancers were identified. Increased risks of incident endometrial carcinoma and fatal uterine corpus cancer were seen for the metabolic syndrome factors combined, as well as for individual factors (except for cholesterol). The relative risk of endometrial carcinoma for the metabolic syndrome was 1.37 (95\% confidence interval: 1.28, 1.46) per 1-unit increment of z score. The positive associations between metabolic syndrome factors (both individually and combined) and endometrial carcinoma were confined to the heaviest women. The association between the metabolic syndrome and endometrial carcinoma risk seems to go beyond the risk conferred by obesity alone, particularly in women with a high body mass index.},

We described trends in mortality rates between 1994-2012 in Dutch patients with T2D, and examined whether these  trends are explained by changes in cardiovascular risk management. We performed a retrospective cohort study using data of 4,020 T2D patients from 9 general practices. Mortality rates for both sexes, and for men and women separately, were compared to standardized mortality rates of the general Dutch population. Cox-proportional-hazards regression was used to analyze whether these trends are associated with changes in systolic blood pressure, low-density-lipoprotein, and glycated hemoglobin, corrected for age and smoking. The results show that the total mortality rates in T2D patients declined from 4.7 (95\% CI 3.1-6.3) in 1994 to 2.5 (95\% CI 1.9- 3.1) in 2012. Mortality rates declined from 4.3 (95\% CI 1.9-6.7) to 2.4 (95\% CI 1.6-3.2) in men and from 5.0 (95\% CI 2.8-7.1) to 2.6 (95\% CI 1.8-3.5) in women. A decrease in low-density-lipoprotein was associated with a significant lower risk of mortality with respective hazard ratio's of 0.683 (95\% CI 0.597 - 0.780) in men and 0.749 (95\% CI 0.663 - 0.848) in women. The results indicated gender-differences, i.e., female patients had slightly higher mortality rates, less statins prescribed, and a higher risk for smoking, than male patients. However, these gender-differences did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that mortality rates in patients with T2D in the Netherlands declined to a level that is comparable to the general population. This decline is probably due to the increased prescription of statins. Future research should focus on gender-differences.},

We investigated the comparative ability of various comorbidity indices to predict perioperative and 5-year all cause mortality after radical cystectomy. We evaluated 891 patients who underwent radical cystectomy between 1994 and 2005. The associations of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson comorbidity index, Elixhauser index and ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status with outcomes were assessed using Cox regression models. Model performance was compared with area under receiver operating curves. A total of 33 (3.7\%) patients died within 90 days of radical cystectomy. On multivariate analysis locally advanced pathological tumor stage (HR 4.86, p = 0.002) as well as Elixhauser index (HR 1.48, p = 0.002), ASA score (HR 3.17, p = 0.001) and ECOG (HR 2.40, p {$<$}0.0001) were significantly associated with 90-day perioperative mortality.

Introduction Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, in which fragility fractures have been reported despite normal BMD. The aim of this study was to assess whether patients with sarcoidosis have an increased risk of clinical fractures compared to the general population. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the CPRD. All patients with a CPRD code for sarcoidosis between January 1987 and September 2012 were included. Cox proportional hazards models were used to derive adjusted relative risks (RRs) of fractures in all sarcoidosis patients compared to matched controls, and within the sarcoidosis group according to use and dose of systemic glucocorticoids. Results Five thousand seven hundred twenty-two sarcoidosis patients (mean age 48.0~years, 51~\% females, mean follow-up 6.7~years) were identified., Compared to 28,704 matched controls, the risk of any fracture was not different in patients with sarcoidosis. However, the risk of clinical vertebral fractures was significantly increased (adj RR 1.77; 95~\% CI 1.06–2.96) and the risk of non-vertebral fractures was decreased although marginally significant (adj RR 0.87; 95~\% CI 0.77–0.99). Compared to sarcoidosis patients not taking glucocorticoids, recent use of systemic glucocorticoids was associated with an increased risk of any fracture (adj RR 1.50; 95~\% CI 1.20–1.89) and of an osteoporotic fracture (adj RR 1.47; 95~\% CI 1.07–2.02). Conclusions Patients with sarcoidosis have an increased risk of clinical vertebral fractures, and when using glucocorticoid therapy, an increased risk of any fractures and osteoporotic fractures. In contrast, the risk of non-vertebral fractures maybe decreased. Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of these contrasting effects on fracture risk.},

  abstract = {The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of a health system and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health and health care policies; and highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Various indicators show that the health of the population has improved over the last few decades. However, inequalities in health across socioeconomic groups have been increasing since the 1970s. The main diseases affecting the population are circulatory diseases, cancer, diseases of the respiratory system and diseases of the digestive system. Risk factors such as the steadily rising levels of alcohol consumption, the sharp increases in adult and child obesity and prevailing smoking levels are among the most pressing public health concerns, particularly as they reflect the growing health inequalities among different socioeconomic groups. Health services in England are largely free at the point of use. The NHS provides preventive medicine, primary care and hospital services to all those ordinarily resident. Over 12\% of the population is covered by voluntary health insurance schemes, known in the United Kingdom as private medical insurance (PMI), which mainly provides access to acute elective care in the private sector. Responsibility for publicly funded health care rests with the Secretary of State for Health, supported by the Department of Health. The Department operates at a regional level through 10 strategic health authorities (SHAs), which are responsible for ensuring the quality and performance of local health services within their geographic area. Responsibility for commissioning health services at the local level lies with 151 primary care organizations, mainly primary care trusts (PCTs), each covering a geographically defined population. Health services are mainly financed from public sources, primarily general taxation and national insurance contributions (NICs). Some care is funded privately through PMI, some user charges, cost sharing and direct payments for health care delivered by NHS and private providers. While the reform programme that developed since 1997 proved to be massive in its scope, some basic features of the English NHS, such as its taxation-funding base, the predominantly public provision of services and division between purchasing (commissioning) and care delivery functions, remain unchanged. Nevertheless, in addition to the unprecedented level of financial resources allocated to the NHS since 2000, the most important reform measures included the introduction of the payment by results (PbR) hospital payment system; the expanded use of private sector provision; the introduction of more autonomous management of NHS hospitals through foundation trusts (FTs); the introduction of patient choice of hospital for elective care; new general practitioner (GP), consultant and dental services contracts; the establishment of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE); and the establishment of the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to regulate providers and monitor quality of services. The English NHS faces future challenges as 2010 draws to a close, with significant restrictions on expenditure and a newly elected government that has announced its intention to introduce further widespread reform.},

  abstract = {Introduction Research suggests that survival among the recipients of a cardiac permanent pacemaker (PPM) matches the age- and sex-matched general population in the absence of cardiovascular disease. We used linked administrative data to examine life expectancy-based outcomes for adults requiring a cardiac PPM. Methods Population-level hospital admissions data were used to identify all recipients of an initial PPM during 1995–2008. Expected years of additional life remaining at the time of implantation were calculated for each patient from population life tables. Observed years were calculated using linked mortality data to end 2011. Cox regression was used to determine demographic and clinical predictors of survival. Results In 8757 patients age-adjusted risk of death to 5years was associated with male sex, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score (excluding cardiac disease), a history of heart failure, cardiomyopathy or atrial fibrillation and emergency admission. Coronary revascularisation surgery reduced long-term risk. The observed/expected ratio of additional years of life was 0.80 for men and 0.84 for women overall, varying from 0.92 for women without significant comorbidity to 0.40 for patients with the highest Charlson score and cardiomyopathy. The oldest patients (80–99 years) did relatively well, probably reflecting patient selection. Heart disease was the most frequent cause of death. Conclusions Life expectancy among PPM recipients without significant comorbidity approached that of the general population. Greater non-cardiac comorbidity, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and, in particular, cardiomyopathy, contributed most to the loss of expected years of life in all age groups. The oldest patients and women did relatively well.},

Methods We studied a prospective cohort of 2132 women, who were recruited following initial breast cancer treatment. Associations of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and hypertension with survival were evaluated in delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models. Results During the median follow-up of nine years, higher CCI scores were independently associated with an increased risk of death from all causes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13 to 1.54) and from non-breast cancer causes (HR = 1.55, 95\% CI = 1.19 to 2.02) but not from breast cancer (HR = 1.14, 95\% CI = .93 to 1.41). Hypertension was also independently associated with an increased risk of death from all causes (HR = 1.55, 95\% CI = 1.20 to 1.99), from non-breast cancer causes (HR = 1.67, 95\% CI = 1.10 to 2.54) and from breast cancer specifically (HR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 1.03 to 2.09). The relationship between the CCI and overall survival was the strongest among women with stage I breast cancer (stage I, HR = 1.65, 95\% CI = 1.26 to 2.16 vs. stage III, HR = .53, 95\% CI = .23 to 1.25). Conclusion Whereas the CCI and hypertension were independently associated with lower overall and non-breast cancer survival, hypertension was also independently associated with lower breast cancer-specific survival. Impact If the observed relationships are causal, treating comorbidities may improve outcomes.},

In a cohort study called Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE), 2,265 women diagnosed with breast cancer were followed for a median of 12 years. We used multivariable proportional-hazards models to determine whether smoking, assessed approximately two years post-diagnosis, was associated with risk of death among these women. We also undertook a systematic review of all cohort studies to date that have examined the association between smoking and breast cancer mortality. Compared with never smokers, women who were current smokers had a twofold higher rate of dying from breast cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.01, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.27–3.18] and an approximately fourfold higher rate of dying from competing (non-breast cancer) causes (HR = 3.84, 95 \% CI 2.50–5.89). Among seven studies that met the inclusion criteria in the systematic review, three studies and our own reported significantly increased risk of breast cancer death with current smoking. We found little evidence of an association between former smoking and breast cancer mortality (HR = 1.24, 95 \% CI 0.94–1.64). Consistent with findings from our prospective observational study, the systematic review of seven additional studies indicates positive association of current smoking with breast cancer mortality, but weak association with former smoking. Women who smoke following breast cancer diagnosis and treatment are at higher risk of death both from breast cancer and other causes.},

However, traditional long-term survival statistics, which are derived by cohort-based types of analysis, essentially reflect the survival expectations of patients diagnosed many years ago. They are therefore often severely outdated at the time they become available. A couple of years ago, a new method of survival analysis, denoted period analysis, has been introduced to derive more 'up-to-date' estimates of long-term survival rates. We give a comprehensive review of the new methodology, its statistical background, empirical evaluation, computational realisation and applications. We conclude that period analysis is a powerful tool to provide more 'up-to-date' cancer survival rates. More widespread use by cancer registries should help to increase the use of cancer survival statistics for patients, clinicians, and public health authorities.},

The study comprised all patients with onset in the period 1949–1996. All case records were validated and classified according to standardized diagnostic criteria. Data on emigration and death were obtained by record linkage to official registers. The end of follow‐up was 1 January 2000 for emigration and death, and 1 January 1999 for cause‐specific deaths. Standardized mortality ratios and excess death rates were calculated for various causes of death and periods after multiple sclerosis onset, and time trends in survival probability were analysed by Cox regression. The study comprised 9881 patients, of whom 4254 had died before end of follow‐up. The median survival time from onset was ∼10 years shorter for multiple sclerosis patients than for the age‐matched general population, and multiple sclerosis was associated with an almost threefold increase in the risk for death. According to death certificates, more than half (56.4\%) of the patients had died from multiple sclerosis. They also had excess mortality rates from other diseases, except cancer, and from accidents and suicide. The probability for survival improved significantly during the observation period. Thus, the 10‐year excess mortality was almost halved in comparison with that in the middle of the 1900s.},

DESIGN: The routine clinical and laboratory characteristics of consecutive patients presenting to an emergency room with decompensated heart failure were documented and the patients followed for an average of 44 months (range 41 to 47). SETTING: One teaching hospital and one community-based hospital in Montreal, Quebec. PATIENTS: A prospective cohort of 153 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency room with decompensated heart failure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Total mortality was the main outcome. Survival status was validated by the government health insurance board. RESULTS: Survival was poor, with 61\% dying within the 47-month follow-up. Univariate analysis revealed the following variables to be associated with decreased survival; low sodium (P {$<$} 0.001), decreased renal function (P {$<$} 0.001), prior hospitalization for decompensated heart failure (P {$<$} 0.001), intraventricular conduction defect (P {$<$} 0.002), failure despite prior use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (P {$<$} 0.005) and increased cardiac dimensions as determined by increased left ventricular end systolic diameter (P {$<$} 0.04). The multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed a prior admission for heart failure (relative risk [RR] 1.9 [P = 0.005], 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.9), hyponatremia (RR 2.1 [P = 0.005], 95\% CI 1.2 to 3.5), presence of an intraventricular conduction delay (RR 1.9 [P = 0.003], 95\% CI 1.2 to 2.9), and the cumulative required dose of intravenous furosemide (RR 1.7 [P = 0.03], 95\% CI 1.1 to 2.8) to be associated with increased mortality. Patients with hyponatremia despite the use of ACE inhibitors were at greatest risk (RR 11.5 [P {$<$} 0.001], 95\% CI 5.3 to 24.9). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective observational study confirms that the long term prognosis of patients needing hospitalization for congestive heart failure remains poor.

A clinic cohort of patients with diabetes and no history of DFU provided a control group. Cause-specific mortality was recorded during a median follow-up duration of 3.6 years (interquartile range, 3.3-4.2 years). The association between DFU and all-cause mortality was evaluated by Cox regression. The association between DFU and cardiovascular mortality was determined by competing risk modeling Results We recorded 145 events of all-cause mortality and 27 events of cardiovascular mortality among 869 patients with diabetes. After adjustment for potential confounders, DFU was associated with both cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 2.53; 95\% confidence interval, 0.98-6.49; P =.05) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 3.98; 95\% confidence interval, 2.55-6.21; P {$<$}.001).

Diagnosis is based on a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern (coved type ST-segment elevation ≥2 mm followed by a negative T-wave in ≥1 of the right precordial leads V1 to V2), observed either spontaneously or during a sodium-channel blocker test. The prevalence varies among regions and ethnicities, affecting mostly males. The risk stratification and management of patients, principally asymptomatic, still remains challenging. The current main therapy is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, but radiofrequency catheter ablation has been recently reported as an effective new treatment. Since its first description in 1992, continuous achievements have expanded our understanding of the genetics basis and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. Currently, despite several genes identified, SCN5A has attracted most attention, and in approximately 30\% of patients, a genetic variant may be implicated in causation after a comprehensive analysis.},

Decompensation was defined by the presence of ascites, either overt or detected by ultrasonography (UD), gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB), and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). AoCLF was defined according to the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver criteria. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the risk of failure (death or orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)).RESULTS:A total of 490 consecutive cirrhotic patients (314 males, mean age 60.9±12.6 years) fulfilled the study criteria. AoCLF was identified in 59 patients (12.0\%). Among the remaining 431 patients, ascites were found in 330 patients (76.6\%): in 257 (77.8\%) as overt ascites and in 73 (22.2\%) as UD ascites. GEVB was observed in 77 patients (17.9\%) and HE in 30 patients (7.0\%). After a median follow-up of 33 months, 24 patients underwent OLT and 125 died. The cumulative incidence of failure (death or OLT) after 1, 2, and 3 years was, respectively, 28, 53, and 62\% in patients with AoCLF; 10, 18, and 25\% in patients with UD ascites; 17, 31, and 41\% in patients with overt ascites; and 8, 12, and 24\% in patients with GEVB (P{$<$}0.0001).CONCLUSIONS:AoCLF is responsible for a relevant proportion of first decompensation in cirrhotic patients and is associated with the poorest outcome. Patients with UD ascites do not have a negligible mortality rate and require clinical monitoring similar to that of patients with overt ascites.},

  abstract = {Background—There are a paucity of data about the long-term natural history of adult Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (WPW) patients in regard to risk of mortality and atrial fibrillation. We sought to describe the long-term outcomes of WPW patients and ascertain the impact of ablation on the natural history. Methods and Results—Three groups of patients were studied: 2 WPW populations (ablation: 872, no ablation: 1461) and a 1:5 control population (n=11 175). Long-term mortality and atrial fibrillation rates were determined. The average follow-up for the WPW group was 7.9±5.9 (median: 6.9) years and was similar between the ablation and nonablation groups. Death rates were similar between the WPW group versus the control group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval, 0.83–1.11; P=0.56). Nonablated WPW patients had a higher long-term death risk compared with ablated WPW patients (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95\% confidence interval: 1.50–20.93; P{$<$}0.0001). Incident atrial fibrillation risk was higher in the WPW group compared with the control population (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95\% confidence interval, 1.29–1.87; P{$<$}0.0001). Nonablated WPW patients had lower risk than ablated patients (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95\% confidence interval, 0.28–0.53; P{$<$}0.0001). Conclusions—Long-term mortality rates in WPW patients are low and similar to an age-matched and gender-matched control population. WPW patients that underwent the multifactorial process of ablation had a lower mortality compared to nonablated WPW patients. Atrial fibrillation rates are high long-term, and ablation does not reduce this risk.},

We examined the association of diabetes with cause-specific mortality, including deaths from specific cancers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective cohort of 1,053,831 U.S. adults, without cancer at baseline, enrolled in the Cancer Prevention Study-II in 1982 and was followed for mortality until December 2008. At baseline, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that included information on diabetes, smoking, physical activity, height, and weight. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) (95\% CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS During 26 years of follow-up, 243,051 men and 222,109 women died. In multivariable models that controlled for age, BMI, and other variables, diabetes was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (women RR 1.90 [95\% CI 1.87–1.93]; men 1.73 [1.70–1.75]). Among women, diabetes was associated with higher risk of death from cancers of the liver (1.40 [1.05–1.86]), pancreas (1.31 [1.14–1.51]), endometrium (1.33 [1.08–1.65]), colon (1.18 [1.04–1.33]), and breast (1.16 [1.03–1.29]). Among men, diabetes was associated with risk of death from cancers of the breast (4.20 [2.20–8.04]), liver (2.26 [1.89–2.70]), oral cavity and pharynx (1.44 [1.07–1.94]), pancreas (1.40 [1.23–1.59]), bladder (1.22 [1.01–1.47]), colon (1.15 [1.03–1.29]), and (inversely) prostate (0.88 [0.79–0.97]). Diabetes was also associated with higher risks of death involving the circulatory system, respiratory system, digestive system, genitourinary system, and external causes/accidental deaths. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes is associated with higher risk of death for many diseases, including several specific forms of cancer.},

  abstract = {Objectives—The aim of the study was to examine the association between levels of past and current alcohol consumption and all-cause and liver-related mortality among people living with HIV (PLWH). Methods—A prospective cohort study of 1855 PLWH in Baltimore, MD was carried out from 2000 to 2013. We ascertained alcohol use by (1) self-report (SR) through a computer-assisted self interview, and (2) medical record abstraction of provider-documented (PD) alcohol use. SR alcohol consumption was categorized as heavy (men: {$>$} 4 drinks/day or {$>$} 14 drinks/week; women: {$>$} 3 drinks/day or {$>$} 7 drinks/week), moderate (any alcohol consumption less than heavy), and none. We calculated the cumulative incidence of liver-related mortality and fitted adjusted causespecific regression models to account for competing risks. Results—All-cause and liver-related mortality rates (MRs) were 43.0 and 7.2 per 1000 personyears (PY), respectively. All-cause mortality was highest among SR nondrinkers with PD recent ({$<$} 6 months) heavy drinking (MR = 85.4 deaths/1000 PY) and lowest among SR moderate drinkers with no PD history of heavy drinking (MR = 23.0 deaths/1000 PY). Compared with SR moderate drinkers with no PD history of heavy drinking, SR nondrinkers and moderate drinkers with PD recent heavy drinking had higher liver-related mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 7.28 and 3.52, respectively]. However, SR nondrinkers and moderate drinkers with a PD drinking history of {$>$} 6 months ago showed similar rates of liver-related mortality (HR = 1.06 and 2.00, respectively). Conclusions—Any heavy alcohol consumption was associated with all-cause mortality among HIV-infected individuals, while only recent heavy consumption was associated with liver-related mortality. Because mortality risk among nondrinkers varies substantially by drinking history, current consumption alone is insufficient to assess risk.},

  abstract = {Progress over the last 50 years has transformed the prospects for people diagnosed with cancer in the UK. In the 1970s, only 1 in 4 cancer patients would survive their disease for ten years or more. By 2010, this had risen to 2 in 4, and survival continues to improve today. This is due to groundbreaking research, innovative new treatments, and the tireless efforts of staff right across the NHS. However, there is still much to be done. This report summarises the current state of cancer in the UK, recognising where progress has been made, and highlighting the challenges that we continue to face. Cancer Research UK’s ambitious vision to see 3 in 4 people with cancer survive for ten years or more by 2034 serves as a driving force, and here we set out many of the steps that we already know must be taken across the UK to achieve this. Cancer remains the leading cause of death in the UK, and a growing and ageing population with more complex needs means incidence continues to rise at an alarming rate. By 2035, the number of new cancer cases is projected to rise to over half a million a year. 4 in 10 cancers are preventable, making efforts to reduce exposure to risk factors such as smoking and obesity crucial to tackling rising incidence. We also see lower survival in the UK than in comparable countries around the world, and significant variation in outcomes across the UK too. To address this, it is essential to diagnose more cancers at an earlier stage through increasing awareness and screening uptake, supporting primary care and growing diagnostic capacity, and to improve survival by ensuring consistent access to optimal treatments. Foremost among these obstacles however, is the increasingly critical shortage of staff with the right skills in our health system. Without a long-term, concerted effort to ensure we have a cancer workforce fit for the future, sustainable progress in improving outcomes will be impossible. This report uses data provided by patients and collected by the health service and cancer registries as part of their care and support. The availability, quality and timeliness of data varies between the different nations of the UK, highlighting the vital need for continued investment in high quality data that will unlock insights than can help improve cancer services. To continue to deliver on the huge potential that exists today to further improve cancer outcomes, we must get better at preventing cancers, diagnosing them earlier and ensuring access to optimal treatment for everyone. Together, these actions will help us beat cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: PREDICT is a breast cancer prognostic and treatment benefit model implemented online. The overall fit of the model has been good in multiple independent case series, but PREDICT has been shown to underestimate breast cancer specific mortality in women diagnosed under the age of 40. Another limitation is the use of discrete categories for tumour size and node status resulting in 'step' changes in risk estimates on moving between categories. We have refitted the PREDICT prognostic model using the original cohort of cases from East Anglia with updated survival time in order to take into account age at diagnosis and to smooth out the survival function for tumour size and node status. METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression models were used to fit separate models for ER negative and ER positive disease. Continuous variables were fitted using fractional polynomials and a smoothed baseline hazard was obtained by regressing the baseline cumulative hazard for each patients against time using fractional polynomials. The fit of the prognostic models were then tested in three independent data sets that had also been used to validate the original version of PREDICT. RESULTS: In the model fitting data, after adjusting for other prognostic variables, there is an increase in risk of breast cancer specific mortality in younger and older patients with ER positive disease, with a substantial increase in risk for women diagnosed before the age of 35. In ER negative disease the risk increases slightly with age. The association between breast cancer specific mortality and both tumour size and number of positive nodes was non-linear with a more marked increase in risk with increasing size and increasing number of nodes in ER positive disease. The overall calibration and discrimination of the new version of PREDICT (v2) was good and comparable to that of the previous version in both model development and validation data sets. However, the calibration of v2 improved over v1 in patients diagnosed under the age of 40. CONCLUSIONS: The PREDICT v2 is an improved prognostication and treatment benefit model compared with v1. The online version should continue to aid clinical decision making in women with early breast cancer.},

Histories of 5 traditional atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation (diabetes, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, and family history of premature heart disease) and hospital mortality were examined among 542,008 patients with first MIs in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (1994 to 2006). On initial MI presentation, history of hypertension (52.3\%) was most common, followed by smoking (31.3\%). The least common risk factor was diabetes (22.4\%). Crude mortality was highest in patients with MI with diabetes (11.9\%) and hypertension (9.8\%) and lowest in those with smoking histories (5.4\%) and dyslipidemia (4.6\%). The inclusion of 5 atherosclerotic risk factors in a stepwise multivariate model contributed little toward predicting hospital mortality over age alone (C-statistic = 0.73 and 0.71, respectively). After extensive multivariate adjustments for clinical and sociodemographic factors, patients with MI with diabetes had higher odds of dying (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.20 to 1.26) than those without diabetes and similarly for hypertension (OR 1.08, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.11). Conversely, family history (OR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.69 to 0.73), dyslipidemia (OR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.64), and smoking (OR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.83 to 0.88) were associated with decreased mortality (C-statistic = 0.82 for the full model). In conclusion, in the setting of acute MI, histories of diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher hospital mortality, but the inclusion of atherosclerotic risk factors in models of hospital mortality does not improve predictive ability beyond other major clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.},

METHODS: We carried out a search in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE database for relevant studies. Relative risks (RRs) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the association between BMI and mortality in patients with COPD. In addition, a baseline risk-adjusted analysis was performed to investigate the strength of this association. RESULTS: 22 studies comprising 21,150 participants were included in this analysis. Compared with patients having a normal BMI, underweight individuals were associated with higher mortality (RR = 1.34, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.78), whereas overweight (RR = 0.47, 95\% CI = 0.33-0.68) and obese (RR = 0.59, 95\% CI = 0.38-0.91) patients were associated with lower mortality. We further performed a baseline risk-adjusted analysis and obtained statistically similar results. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that for patients with COPD being overweight or obese had a protective effect against mortality. However, the relationship between BMI and mortality in different classes of obesity needed further clarification in well-designed clinical studies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential for reducing cardiovascular risk factors in the United States of America enough to cause age-adjusted coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates to drop by 20\% (from 2000 baseline figures) by 2010, as targeted under the Healthy People 2010 initiative. METHODS: Using a previously validated, comprehensive CHD mortality model known as IMPACT that integrates trends in all the major cardiovascular risk factors, stratified by age and sex, we calculated how much CHD mortality would drop between 2000 and 2010 in the projected population of the United States aged 25-84 years (198 million). We did this for three assumed scenarios: (i) if recent risk factor trends were to continue to 2010; (ii) success in reaching all the Healthy People 2010 risk factor targets, and (iii) further drops in risk factors, to the levels already seen in the low-risk stratum. FINDINGS: If age-adjusted CHD mortality rates observed in 2000 remained unchanged, some 388,000 CHD deaths would occur in 2010. First scenario: if recent risk factor trends continued to 2010, there would be approximately 19,000 fewer deaths than in 2000. Although improved total cholesterol, lowered blood pressure in men, decreased smoking and increased physical activity would account for some 51,000 fewer deaths, these would be offset by approximately 32,000 additional deaths from adverse trends in obesity and diabetes and in blood pressure in women. Second scenario: If Healthy People 2010 cardiovascular risk factor targets were reached, approximately 188,000 CHD deaths would be prevented. Scenario three: If the cardiovascular risk levels of the low-risk stratum were reached, approximately 372,000 CHD deaths would be prevented. CONCLUSION: Achievement of the Healthy People 2010 cardiovascular risk factor targets would almost halve the predicted CHD death rates. Additional reductions in major risk factors could prevent or postpone substantially more deaths from CHD},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse short- and long-term outcomes and prognostic factors in a large population-based cohort of unselected patients with a first emergency admission for suspected acute coronary syndrome between 1990 and 2000 in Scotland. METHODS: All first emergency admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and all first emergency admissions for angina (the proxy for unstable angina) between 1990 and 2000 in Scotland (population 5.1 million) were identified. Survival to five years was examined by Cox multivariate modelling to examine the independent prognostic effects of diagnosis, age, sex, year of admission, socioeconomic deprivation and co-morbidity. RESULTS: In Scotland between 1990 and 2000, 133,429 individual patients had a first emergency admission for suspected acute coronary syndrome: 96 026 with AMI and 37,403 with angina. After exclusion of deaths within 30 days, crude five-year case fatality was similarly poor for patients with angina and those with AMI (23.9\% v 21.6\% in men and 23.5\% v 26.0\% in women). The longer-term risk of a subsequent fatal or non-fatal event in the five years after first hospital admission was high: 54\% in men after AMI (53\% in women) and 56\% after angina (49\% in women). Event rates increased threefold with increasing age and 20-60\% with different co-morbidities, but were 11-34\% lower in women. CONCLUSIONS: Longer-term case fatality was similarly high in patients with angina and in survivors of AMI, about 5\% a year. Furthermore, half the patients experienced a fatal or non-fatal event within five years. These data may strengthen the case for aggressive secondary prevention in all patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome.},

We aimed to externally validate previously derived Charlson Comorbity Index for OLT (CCI-OLT); subsequently, we developed a new model to predict 5-year mortality after transplant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This single center retrospective cohort study included 524 consecutive adult cirrhotic patients who underwent OLT in 2002-2012. External validation of CCI-OLT used Kaplan-Meier method. Derivation of the new predictive model used Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: One-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative survival after OLT was 89\%, 80\%, and 73\%, respectively. CCI-OLT was not associated with 5-year mortality after transplant (P = 0.34). We derived and internally validated a new predictive model of 5-year mortality after OLT based on six pre-transplant characteristics of patients: age, body mass index, hepatitis C, hepatic encephalopathy, intensive care unit stay at transplant, and live donor (C-index = 0.64). We further developed a nomogram to estimate individual probability of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival after OLT. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, CCI-OLT was not associated with survival following transplant. The new predictive model discriminative capacity was only modest, suggesting that pre-transplant characteristics are of limited value in predicting post-transplant outcomes in thoroughly selected patients.},

Patients and Methods A cohort of 7,657 patients with newly diagnosed stage I to III colorectal cancer were identified from 1998 to 2009 from the National Cancer Data Repository (comprising English cancer registry data). This cohort was linked to the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, which provided prescription records, and to mortality data from the Office of National Statistics (up to 2012) to identify 1,647 colorectal cancer–specific deaths. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for cancer-specific mortality and 95\% CIs by postdiagnostic statin use and to adjust these HRs for potential confounders.   Results Overall, statin use after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with reduced colorectal cancer–specific mortality (fully adjusted HR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.61 to 0.84). A dose-response association was apparent; for example, a more marked reduction was apparent in colorectal cancer patients using statins for more than 1 year (adjusted HR, 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.79). A reduction in all-cause mortality was also apparent in statin users after colorectal cancer diagnosis (fully adjusted HR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.84).   Conclusion In this large population-based cohort, statin use after diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with longer rates of survival.},

We investigated whether statins used after breast cancer diagnosis reduced the risk of breast cancer-specific, or all-cause, mortality in a large cohort of breast cancer patients.         Methods: A cohort of 17,880 breast cancer patients, newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, was identified from English cancer registries (from the National Cancer Data Repository). This cohort was linked to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, providing prescription records, and to the Office of National Statistics mortality data (up to 2013), identifying 3694 deaths, including 1469 deaths attributable to breast cancer. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer-specific, and all-cause, mortality in statin users after breast cancer diagnosis were calculated using time-dependent Cox regression models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using multiple imputation methods, propensity score methods and a case-control approach.         Results: There was some evidence that statin use after a diagnosis of breast cancer had reduced mortality due to breast cancer and all causes (fully adjusted HR = 0.84 [95\% confidence interval = 0.68–1.04] and 0.84 [0.72–0.97], respectively). These associations were more marked for simvastatin 0.79 (0.63–1.00) and 0.81 (0.70–0.95), respectively.         Conclusions: In this large population-based breast cancer cohort, there was some evidence of reduced mortality in statin users after breast cancer diagnosis.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional measures have a great appeal for prognostic instruments because they are associated with mortality, they represent the end-impact of disease on the patient, and information about them can be obtained directly from the patient. However, there are no prognostic indices that have been developed for community-dwelling elders based primarily on functional measures. Our objective in this study was to develop and validate a prognostic index for 2-year mortality in community-dwelling elders, based on self-reported functional status, age, and gender. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study from 1993 to 1995. SETTING: Community-dwelling elders within the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects, age {$>$} or =70 (N = 7,393), from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old study. We developed the index in 4,516 participants (mean age 78, 84\% white, 61\% female), and validated it in 2,877 different participants (mean age 78, 73\% white, 61\% female). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prediction of 2-year mortality using risk factors such as activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, additional measures of physical function, age, and gender. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 10\% in the development cohort and 12\% in the validation cohort. In the development cohort, 6 independent predictors of mortality were identified and weighted, using logistic regression models, to create a point scale: male gender, 2 points; age (76 to 80, 1 point; {$>$}80, 2 points); dependence in bathing, 1 point; dependence in shopping, 2 points; difficulty walking several blocks, 2 points; and difficulty pulling or pushing heavy objects, 1 point. We calculated risk scores for each patient by adding the points of each independent risk factor present. In the development cohort, 2-year mortality was 3\% in the lowest risk group (0 to 2 points), 11\% in the middle risk group (3 to 6 points), and 34\% in the highest risk group ({$>$}7 points). In the validation cohort, 2-year mortality was 5\% in the lowest risk group, 12\% in the middle risk group, and 36\% in the highest risk group. The c-statistics for the point system were 0.76 and 0.74 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This prognostic index, which relies solely on self-reported functional status, age, and gender, provides a simple and accurate method of stratifying community-dwelling elders into groups at varying risk of mortality.},

DESIGN: Cohort study of Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) participants enrolled between 1988 and 1996. SETTING: Eleven PACE sites, a community-based long-term care program that cares for frail, chronically ill elderly people who meet criteria for nursing home placement. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand eight hundred ninety-nine PACE enrollees. The index was developed in 2,232 participants and validated in 1,667. MEASUREMENTS: Time to death was predicted using risk factors obtained from a geriatric assessment performed by the PACE interdisciplinary team at the time of enrollment. Risk factors included demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and functional status. RESULTS: The development cohort had a mean age of 79 (68\% female, 40\% white). The validation cohort had a mean age of 79 (76\% female, 65\% white). In the development cohort, eight independent risk factors of mortality were identified and weighted, using Cox regression, to create a risk score: male sex, 2 points; age (75-79, 2 points; 80-84, 2 points; {$>$} or = 85, 3 points); dependence in toileting, 1 point; dependence in dressing (partial dependence, 1 point; full dependence, 3 points); malignant neoplasm, 2 points; congestive heart failure, 3 points; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 point; and renal insufficiency, 3 points. In the development cohort, respective 1- and 3-year mortality rates were 6\% and 21\% in the lowest-risk group (0-3 points), 12\% and 36\% in the middle-risk group (4-5 points), and 21\% and 54\% in the highest-risk group ({$>$} 5 points).

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the point score was 0.66 and 0.69 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: A multidimensional prognostic index was developed and validated using age, sex, functional status, and comorbidities that effectively stratifies frail, community-living elderly people into groups at varying risk of mortality.},

This review examines in detail the possible mechanisms by which obesity causes poor prognosis of breast cancer such as estrogenic activity, advanced or more aggressive disease at diagnosis and high likelihood of both local and systemic treatment failure. After careful consideration of the available evidence, the author concludes that obesity contributes towards development and poor prognosis of breast cancer; therefore, weight management should be an integral part of any strategy to prevent and improve the outcome of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies assessing general and abdominal obesity measures or their combination for mortality prediction have shown inconsistent results. We aimed to systematically review the associations of body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) with all-cause mortality in prospective cohort studies. In this systematic review, which includes a meta-regression analysis, we analysed the associations with all-cause mortality of BMI, WHR, WC and WHtR in prospective cohort studies available in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Esbiobase from inception through 7 May 2010. A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 689 465 participants and 48 421 deaths during 5–24 years of follow-up. The studies were heterogeneous, mainly due to differences in categorization of anthropometric parameters (AP) and different approaches to statistical analysis. Both general and abdominal obesity measures were significantly associated with mortality. In analyses using categorical variables, BMI and WC showed predominantly U- or J-shaped associations with mortality, whereas WHR and WHtR demonstrated positive relationships with mortality. All measures showed similar risk patterns for upper quantiles in comparison to reference quantiles. The parameters of general and abdominal obesity each remained significantly associated with mortality when adjusted for the other. This evidence suggests that abdominal obesity measures such as WC or WHR, show information independent to measures of general obesity and should be used in clinical practice, in addition to BMI, to assess obesity-related mortality in adults.},

One explanation for this is that depression was not associated with increased mortality in these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression was associated with an increased risk of mortality in a subsample of the ENRICHD trial's depressed patients compared with a group of nondepressed patients recruited for an ancillary study. Three hundred fifty-eight depressed patients with an acute AMI from the ENRICHD clinical trial and 408 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria were followed for up to 30 months. There were 47 deaths (6.1\%) and 57 nonfatal AMIs (7.4\%). After adjusting for other risk factors, depressed patients were at higher risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.4, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.7) but not for nonfatal recurrent infarction (hazard ratio 1.2, 95\% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.0) compared with nondepressed patients. In conclusion, depression was an independent risk factor for death after AMI, but it did not have a significant effect on mortality until nearly 12 months after the acute event, nor did it predict nonfatal recurrent infarction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Anemia is common in cancer patients, although the prevalence is influenced both by the type of malignancy and the choice of treatment. Individual studies have compared the survival of patients with and without anemia and have shown reduced survival times in patients with various malignancies, including carcinoma of the lung, cervix, head and neck, prostate, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The objective of this study was to systematically review, to summarize, and to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of anemia on survival in patients with malignant disease. METHODS A comprehensive literature review was carried out using the MEDLINE data base and reviewing the reference lists from published studies. Two hundred papers were identified. Of these, 60 papers that reported the survival of cancer patients according to either hemoglobin levels or the presence of anemia were included. Among these papers, 25\% related to patients with lung carcinoma, 17\% related to patients with head and neck carcinoma, 12\% related to patients with multiple myeloma, 10\% related to patients with prostate carcinoma, 8\% related to patients with cervicouterine carcinoma, 7\% related to patients with leukemia, 5\% related to patients with lymphoma, and 16\% related to patients with other types of malignancies. RESULTS The relative risk of death increased by 19\% (95\% confidence interval, 10–29\%) in anemic patients with lung carcinoma, by 75\% (37–123\%) in anemic patients with head and neck carcinoma, by 47\% (21–78\%) in anemic patients with prostate carcinoma, and by 67\% (30–113\%) in anemic patients with lymphoma. The overall estimate increase in risk was 65\% (54–77\%).

Our objective was to evaluate the association between the 6MWD and outcome in patients with severe AS while remaining under medical treatment. In a prospective observational cohort study, a total of 149 patients diagnosed with severe AS by Doppler echocardiography underwent a 6-minute walk test. The single end point was a composite of all-cause death or hospitalization for heart failure. Patients receiving an AVI were censored from follow-up at the time of their AVI, so that only the events that occurred while the patients remained under medical treatment were included in the analysis. During follow-up (median 12.9~months), the end point occurred in 65 patients (43.6\%). Univariate analysis showed an association between the 6MWD and the end point (p {$<$}0.001). After adjustment for symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction, aortic valve area, Charlson co-morbidity score, and anemia, the 6MWD independently predicted the end point (adjusted hazard ratio 0.63; 95\% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.89; p~= 0.010). The incidence of the composite end point was 12 per 100 patient-years in patients with a 6MWD {$>$}331~m compared to 86 per 100 patient-years in those with a 6MWD ≤331~m~(p {$<$}0.001). In conclusion, although patients with severe AS remain under medical treatment, the 6MWD is independently associated with all-cause death or hospitalization for heart failure.},

The prognostic factors including Japanese classification, AJCC/UICC TNM classification and metastatic lymph node ratio (1–10\% and {$>$}10\%) were evaluated in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results The multivariate analysis showed that Borrmann classification, pN–category of AJCC/UICC classification and metastatic lymph node ratio were the most significant prognostic factors and a higher hazard ratio was obtained for metastatic lymph node ratio than pN category of AJCC/UICC classification (4.5 vs. 11.4). When the metastatic ratio groups of 1–10\% and {$>$}10\% were subdivided into pN1, pN2 and pN3 categories of the AJCC/UICC classification, there was no statistical difference between survival curves.

The aims were to (i) describe patients with HF and dementia, assess (ii) the proportion of specific dementia disorders in types of HF based on ejection fraction and (iii) the prognostic role of types of HF and dementia disorders. Methods and results The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (RiksSvikt) and The Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem) were record-linked. Associations between dementia disorders and HF types were assessed with multinomial logistic regression and survival was investigated with Kaplan–Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression. We studied 775 patients found in both registries (55\% men, mean age 82 years). Ejection fraction was preserved in 38\% of patients, reduced in 34\%, and missing in 28\%. The proportions of dementia disorders were similar across HF types. Vascular dementia was the most common dementia disorder (36\%), followed by other dementias (28\%), mixed dementia (20\%), and Alzheimer disease (16\%). Over a mean follow-up of 1.5 years, 76\% of patients survived 1 year. We observed no significant differences in survival with regard to HF type (P = 0.2) or dementia disorder (P = 0.5). After adjustment for baseline covariates, neither HF types nor dementia disorders were independently associated with survival. Conclusions Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was the most common HF type and vascular dementia was the most common dementia disorder. The proportions of dementia disorders were similar across HF types. Neither HF types nor specific dementia disorders were associated with survival.},

However, the risk and incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unknown.Hypothesis: The risk of SCD in persons with sarcoidosis is higher than in the general population.Methods: A population based cohort of all 345 incident cases (50\% males) of sarcoidosis and 345 age- and sex-matched comparators in Olmsted County, MN, USA during 1976-2013 was used to assess SCD risk. Each case was manually reviewed and abstracted. Mortality, including time, place and cause of death were individually reviewed for SCD events. SCD incidence rates are reported per 100,000 person-years and Cox proportional hazards models used for comparing groups.Results: Mean (SD) age at diagnosis of sarcoidosis was 45.6 (13.6) years. Follow-up: median 12.9 (6.0, 23.4) years; total 5,220 person-years. Of the 58 deaths in patients with sarcoidosis, 10 were due to SCD vs. 57 all-cause and 9 SCDs in comparators. Incidence rate of SCD in sarcoidosis was 192 vs. 155 in comparators (HR 1.28 (95\%CI 0.52-3.17, p=0.59). Nocturnal deaths were more frequent in sarcoidosis: incidence rate 57 vs. 17, HR 3.76 (95\%CI 0.39-36.47, p=0.25). No significant difference was detected between groups by sex, age/calendar year of diagnosis, disease duration or by primary organ (pulmonary, cardiac, neuro or hepatic) involvement.Conclusions: Patients with sarcoidosis are not at increased risk for SCD. While there were more nocturnal deaths among patients with sarcoidosis, this did not reach statistical significance.Download figureDownload PowerPointDownload figureDownload PowerPoint},

Whether the impact of comorbidities on outcomes is greater in AF than the general population is unknown. Methods 1430 AF patients and community controls matched 1:1 on age and sex were obtained from Olmsted County, Minnesota. Andersen-Gill and Cox regression estimated associations of 19 comorbidities with hospitalization and death, respectively. Results AF cases had a higher prevalence of most comorbidities. Hypertension (25.4\%), coronary artery disease (17.7\%), and heart failure (13.3\%) had the largest attributable risk of AF; these along with obesity and smoking explained 51.4\% of AF. Over a mean follow-up of 6.3 years, AF patients experienced higher rates of hospitalization and death than population controls. However, the impact of comorbidities on hospitalization and death was generally not greater in AF patients compared to controls, with the exception of smoking. Ever smokers with AF experienced higher than expected risks of hospitalization and death, with observed vs. expected (assuming additivity of effects) hazard ratios compared to never smokers without AF of 1.78 (1.56–2.02) vs. 1.52 for hospitalization and 2.41 (2.02–2.87) vs. 1.84 for death. Conclusions Patients with AF have a higher prevalence of most comorbidities; however, the impact of comorbidities on hospitalization and death is generally similar in AF and controls. Smoking is a notable exception; ever smokers with AF experienced higher than expected risks of hospitalization and death. Thus, interventions targeting modifiable behaviors may benefit AF patients by reducing their risk of adverse outcomes.},

Compared with nonusers, participants who regularly used aspirin after diagnosis experienced a multivariate hazard ratio (HR) for colorectal cancer–specific mortality of 0.71 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.95) and for overall mortality of 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.65-0.97). Among 719 participants who did not use aspirin before diagnosis, aspirin use initiated after diagnosis was associated with a multivariate HR for colorectal cancer–specific mortality of 0.53 (95\% CI, 0.33-0.86). Among 459 participants with colorectal cancers that were accessible for immunohistochemical assessment, the effect of aspirin differed significantly according to cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression (P for interaction = .04). Regular aspirin use after diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer–specific mortality among participants in whom primary tumors overexpressed COX-2 (multivariate HR, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.76), whereas aspirin use was not associated with lower risk among those with primary tumors with weak or absent expression (multivariate HR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 0.36-4.18). Conclusion Regular aspirin use after the diagnosis of colorectal cancer is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer–specific and overall mortality, especially among individuals with tumors that overexpress COX-2.},

In this report we present the clinical features of 229 patients with motor neuron disease (218 sporadic and 11 familial) diagnosed in 1989 and 1990 and compare their prognosis with previous studies of survival. The overall 50\% survival from symptom onset was 2.5 years (95\% CI, 2.2-3.0) and 5-year survival 28\% (95\% CI, 20-36\%). The presence of progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), either at presentation or developing during the course of the illness, significantly reduced survival and was the most important prognostic indicator. Patients who survived longer than 5 years from symptom onset did not have PBP as part of their presenting illness. The prognosis was worse for women, and this was in part related to the higher frequency of PBP in older women, but age was also an independent adverse risk factor. Differences in survival between this and previous series can probably be explained on the basis of variation in case definition and ascertainment methods.},

The hospital covered a catchment population of 150,000. METHODS: A detailed review of 212 patient notes was carried out with the aid of a purposely designed structured data collection form. Postal questionnaires were sent to those patients not currently attending to determine survival/state of health. Death certificates were analysed to determine the cause of death. RESULTS: A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinical grounds in 63 of the 212 cases, with histological proof confirming sarcoidosis in 149 cases. There was a slightly higher incidence in females than males, with four familial instances documented. There was pulmonary involvement in 192 cases classified in the usual way at presentation and the course of these patients was studied. Patients with Stage 1 and 2 disease had resolution rates in excess of 80\%, and Stage 3 50\%. For the remainder, two patterns emerged: one group with persistent infiltration or fibrosis but little disability or disease progression, and another with advancing disease refractory to steroid therapy with a bad prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The good prognosis of patients with Stage 1 disease was confirmed. There were fewer patients presenting with Stage 2 and 3 disease and their prognosis was better than in other published studies. Overall, the numbers of patients progressing from one stage to another was small. Although there was a small group of patients with steroid-refractory, progressive, fibrosis with a bad prognosis, the mortality rate from sarcoidosis in this study was small.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: “0”, 12\% (181); “1–2”, 26\% (225); “3–4”, 52\% (71); and “⩾ 5”, 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: “0”, 8\% (588); “1”, 25\% (54); “2”, 48\% (25); “ ⩾ 3”, 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank χ2 = 165; p {$<$} 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p {$<$} 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

DESIGN AND SETTING 5-year follow-up (2004-2005) of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study (AusDiab, 1999-2000). PARTICIPANTS 6060 AusDiab participants aged 25 years or older who did not have diagnosed diabetes at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incident diabetes at follow-up was defined by treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents or by fasting plasma glucose level {$>$} or = 7.0 mmol/L or 2-hour plasma glucose level in an oral glucose tolerance test {$>$} or = 11.1 mmol/L. The risk prediction model was developed using logistic regression and converted to a simple score, which was then validated in two independent Australian cohorts (the Blue Mountains Eye Study and the North West Adelaide Health Study) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) chi(2) statistic. RESULTS 362 people developed diabetes. Age, sex, ethnicity, parental history of diabetes, history of high blood glucose level, use of antihypertensive medications, smoking, physical inactivity and waist circumference were included in the final prediction model. The AROC of the diabetes risk tool was 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.76-0.81) and HL chi(2) statistic was 4.1 (P = 0.85). Using a score {$>$} or = 12 (maximum, 35), the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for identifying incident diabetes were 74.0\%, 67.7\% and 12.7\%, respectively. The AROC and HL chi(2) statistic in the two independent validation cohorts were 0.66 (95\% CI, 0.60-0.71) and 9.2 (P = 0.32), and 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.72-0.86) and 29.4 (P {$<$} 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS This diabetes risk assessment tool provides a simple, non-invasive method to identify Australian adults at high risk of type 2 diabetes who might benefit from interventions to prevent or delay its onset.},

Among adults with diabetes, 10-year relative changes in mortality were significant for major CVD (-32.7\% [95\% CI -37.2, -27.9]), IHD (-40.3\% [-44.7, -35.6]), and stroke (-29.2\% [-40.0, -16.5]), but not heart failure (-0.5\% [-20.7, 24.7]), and arrhythmia (-12.0\% [-29.4, 77.5]); the absolute decrease of major CVD among adults with diabetes was higher than among adults without diabetes (P {$<$} 0.001). Men with diabetes had larger decreases in CVD death than women with diabetes (P {$<$} 0.001).CONCLUSIONSMajor CVD mortality in adults with diabetes has declined, especially in men. Large reductions were observed for IHD and stroke mortality, although heart failure and arrhythmia deaths did not change. All race and education groups benefitted to a similar degree, but significant gaps remained across groups.},

Basic information and data on medical comorbidities for 2938 patients who received liver transplants between July 1, 1998, and December 31, 2012, were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database on the basis of ICD-9-codes. Mortality risks were analyzed after adjusting for preoperative comorbidities and compared among age cohorts. All patients were followed up until the study endpoint or death. This study finally included 2588 adults and 350 children [2068 (70.4\%) male and 870 (29.6\%) female patients]. The median age at transplantation was 52 (interquartile range, 43–58) years. Recipients were categorized into the following age cohorts: {$<$}20 (n = 350, 11.9\%), 20–39 (n = 254, 8.6\%), 40–59 (n = 1860, 63.3\%), and ≥60 (n = 474, 16.1\%) years. In the total population, 428 deaths occurred after liver transplantation, and the median follow-up period was 2.85 years (interquartile range, 1.2–5.5 years). Dialysis patients showed the highest risk of mortality irrespective of age. Further, the risk of death increased with an increase in the age at transplantation. Older liver transplant recipients (≥60 years), especially dialysis patients, have a higher mortality rate, possibly because they have more medical comorbidities. Our findings should make clinicians aware of the need for better risk stratification among elderly liver transplantation candidates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is relatively rare, yet the economic and social burden is substantial. Having accurate incidence and prevalence estimates would facilitate efficient allocation of healthcare resources. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive and critical review of the epidemiological literature on ALS. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE (1995-2011) databases of population-based studies on ALS incidence and prevalence reporting quantitative data were analyzed. Data extracted included study location and time, design and data sources, case ascertainment methods and incidence and/or prevalence rates. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated, and ALS case estimates were derived using 2010 population estimates. RESULTS: In all, 37 articles met the inclusion criteria. In Europe, the median incidence rate (/100,000 population) was 2.08 (IQR 1.47-2.43), corresponding to an estimated 15,355 (10,852-17,938) cases. Median prevalence (/100,000 population) was 5.40 (IQR 4.06-7.89), or 39,863 (29,971-58,244) prevalent cases. CONCLUSIONS: Disparity in rates among ALS incidence and prevalence studies may be due to differences in study design or true variations in population demographics such as age and geography, including environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Additional large-scale studies that use standardized case ascertainment methods are needed to more accurately assess the true global burden of ALS.},

The median survival time from onset to death ranges from 20 to 48 months, but 10–20\% of ALS patients have a survival longer than 10 years. Older age and bulbar onset are consistently reported to have a worse outcome. There are conflicting data on gender, diagnostic delay and El Escorial criteria. The rate of symptom progression was revealed to be an independent prognostic factor. Psychosocial factors, FTD, nutritional status, and respiratory function are also related to ALS outcome. The effect of enteral nutrition on survival is still unclear, while NIPPV has been found to improve survival. There are no well established biological markers of progression, although some are likely to emerge in the near future. These findings have relevant implications for the design of future trials. Randomization, besides the type of onset, should take into account age, respiratory status at entry, and a measure of disease progression pre-entry. Alternative trial designs can include the use of natural history controls, the so-called minimization method for treatment allocation, and the futility approach.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that obesity, an established cause of renal cell cancer (RCC), may also be associated with a better prognosis. To evaluate the association between RCC survival and obesity, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with RCC and undertook a meta-analysis of the published evidence. We collected clinical and pathologic data from 1,543 patients who underwent nephrectomy for RCC between 1994 and 2008 with complete follow-up through 2008. Patients were grouped according to BMI (kg/m2): underweight {$<$}18.5, normal weight 18.5 to {$<$}23, overweight 23 to {$<$}25 and obese ≥25. We estimated survival using the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models to examine the impact of BMI on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) with adjustment for covariates. We performed a meta-analysis of BMI and OS, CSS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) from all relevant studies using a random-effects model. The 5-year CSS increased from 76.1\% in the lowest to 92.7\% in the highest BMI category. A multivariate analysis showed higher OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.45; 95\% CI: 0.29–0.68) and CSS (HR = 0.47; 95\% CI: 0.29–0.77] in obese patients than in normal weight patients. The meta-analysis further corroborated that high BMI significantly improved OS (HR = 0.57; 95\% CI: 0.43–0.76), CSS (HR = 0.59; 95\% CI: 0.48–0.74) and RFS (HR = 0.49; 95\% CI: 0.30–0.81). Our study shows that preoperative BMI is an independent prognostic indicator for survival among patients with RCC.},

  abstract = {Background: The 1997 international consensus conference on renal cell cancer (RCC) prognosis suggested erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and anaemia as prognostic biomarkers, but most studies reviewed were limited by small sample sizes. Methods: The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate whether ESR, ALP, haemoglobin (Hb), and haematocrit (Hct) could predict survival outcomes in 1307 patients with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) who underwent nephrectomy during 1994–2008. Results: During a median follow-up of 43 months, we found that the patients with preoperative high levels of ESR, had a 2.10-fold (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.21–3.67) greater risk of dying from RCC compared with patients with low levels (normal range). Patients with preoperative anaemia, assessed by Hb and Hct, had a 3.11-fold (95\% CI: 1.17–8.25) and 6.20-fold (95\% CI: 2.30–16.72) greater risk of dying from other illnesses, respectively, compared with patients without anaemia. ALP levels were not associated with ccRCC patients' survival. These associations for ESR and anaemia were more pronounced in patients with body mass index (BMI) {$<$}25 compared with patients with BMI ⩾25\,kg\,m−2. Conclusion: Preoperative high ESR, but not ALP, was a significant predictor for cancer-specific survival among ccRCC patients. Anaemia increases the risk of death from other illness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a rapidly growing etiology of end-stage liver disease in the US. Temporal trends and outcomes in NASH-related liver transplantation (LT) in the US were studied. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study utilizing the United Network for Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation (UNOS/OPTN) 2003-2014 database was conducted to evaluate the frequency of NASH-related LT. Etiology-specific post-transplant survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Overall, 63,061 adult patients underwent LT from 2003 to 2014, including 20,782 HCV (32.96\%), 9470 ALD (15.02\%), and 8262 NASH (13.11\%). NASH surpassed ALD and became the second leading indication for LT beginning in 2008, accounting for 17.38\% of LT in 2014. From 2003 to 2014, the number of LT secondary to NASH increased by 162\%, whereas LT secondary to HCV increased by 33\% and ALD increased by 55\%. Due to resurgence in ALD, the growth in NASH and ALD was comparable from 2008 to 2014 (NASH +50.15\% vs. ALD +41.87\%). The post-transplant survival in NASH was significantly higher compared to HCV (5-year survival: NASH -77.81\%, 95\% CI 76.37-79.25 vs. HCV -72.15\%, 95\% CI 71.37-72.93, P~{$<~$}.001). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, NASH demonstrated significantly higher post-transplant survival compared to HCV (HR 0.75; 95\% CI 0.71-0.79, P~{$<~$}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Currently, NASH is the most rapidly growing indication for LT in the US. Despite resurgence in ALD, NASH remains the second leading indication for LT.},

  abstract = {What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? * Little is known on the association between obesity and urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB). Most studies have shown that higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with higher rates of perioperative complications. Only one study specifically investigated obesity and bladder cancer-specific outcomes and reported no significant association between higher BMI and disease-specific survival in patients with UCB treated with radical cystectomy. However, that study was limited by its small sample size and a high rate of preoperative therapies. * In contrast to the only previous study evaluating the association of BMI with oncological outcomes in UCB, we found that obesity (BMI ≥30\,kg/m2) was associated with features of biologically aggressive UCB and clinical outcomes after radical cystectomy and, even when adjusting for the effects of standard clinicopathological features, obesity remained an independent predictor of cancer recurrence, cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality. Objective * To investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and oncological outcomes in patients after radical cystectomy (RC) for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) in a large multi-institutional series. Patients and Methods * Data were collected from 4118 patients treated with RC and pelvic lymphadenectomy for UCB. Patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. * Univariable and multivariable models tested the effect of BMI on disease recurrence, cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality. * BMI was analysed as a continuous and categorical variable ({$<$}25 vs 25–29 vs ≥30\,kg/m2). Results * Median BMI was 28.8\,kg/m2 (interquartile range 7.9); 25.3\% had a BMI {$<$}25\,kg/m2, 32.5\% had a BMI between 25 and 29.9\,kg/m2, and 42.2\% had a BMI ≥30\,kg/m2. * Patients with a higher BMI were older (P {$<$} 0.001), had higher tumour grade (P {$<$} 0.001), and were more likely to have positive soft tissue surgical margins (P = 0.006) compared with patients with lower BMI. * In multivariable analyses that adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathological features, BMI {$>$}30 was associated with higher risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 1.67, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.46–1.91, P {$<$} 0.001), cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.43, 95\% CI 1.24–1.66, P {$<$} 0.001), and overall mortality (HR 1.81, CI 1.60–2.05, P {$<$} 0.001). Themain limitation is the retrospective design of the study. Conclusions * Obesity is associated with worse cancer-specific outcomes in patients treated with RC for UCB. * Focusing on patient-modifiable factors such as BMI may have significant individual and public health implications in patients with invasive UCB.},

The average annual incidence of polymyalgia rheumatica in the population increased from 19.8 per 100 000 in persons 50 to 59 years of age, to a maximum of 112.2 per 100 000 in persons 70 to 79 years of age. Eighty-three of the 96 patients (86\%) had recovered by the end of the study. Median duration of the disease was 11 months (range, 2 to 54 months). Polymyalgia rheumatica had no effect on survival. Both corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used in treatment. Response was more rapid in patients given corticosteroids, but nonsteroidal drugs were used successfully, especially in milder cases. Relapses and adverse reactions to treatment were more frequent in patients given corticosteroids. The findings show that polymyalgia rheumatica is a relatively common disease in middle-aged and older persons and generally runs a self-limited course.},

  abstract = {Background—Identifying factors predictive of mortality may be important to decrease risk associated with cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) replacement procedures. This study aimed to determine whether clinical factors and complications independently associate with death and to develop a mortality risk prediction tool after CIED replacement. Methods and Results—The prospective REPLACE Registry determined 6-month complication and mortality rates after CIED replacement with or without planned lead addition or revision. Vital status was collected. Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify patient, procedural, or complication variables predictive of death. The REPLACE DARE (Death After Replacement Evaluation) Score was constructed using hazard ratios, reflecting relative risk contributions of each variable, combined into an additive mortality risk score equation. At 6 months, 70 of 1744 (4.0\%) patients had died. Cox regression analysis found no significant association between major complications and death. However, recent heart failure admission, New York Heart Association class III/IV, antiarrhythmic drug use, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease stage were independently associated with 6-month mortality. The REPLACE DARE Score was 2.0±1.4 in survivors versus 3.5±1.8 in nonsurvivors (P{$<$}0.001), with predictive receiver operating characteristic value=0.758 (P{$<$}0.001). Risk of death was 1.0\% for DARE=0 and 55.6\% for DARE=7. The hazard ratio was 1.8 for each change of 1 DARE unit. Conclusions—Comorbidities, but not complications, were significantly associated with mortality after CIED replacement. The REPLACE DARE Score is a novel tool that can identify patients with substantial mortality risk. Such patients should have the relative risk and benefit of their procedure considered carefully.

Predictors of hospitalization and patterns of cardiovascular events over the lifetime of patients with HF have not been elucidated. Methods and Results We examined recurrent hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, and survival among newly discharged (April 1999–March 2001) patients with HF in the Enhanced Feedback For Effective Cardiac Treatment phase 1 study. During 10-year follow-up, we examined all new cardiovascular hospitalizations and selected predictors of readmission. Among 8543 patients (mean age, 77.4±10.5 years; 51.6\% women) followed for 22 567 person-years, 60.7\% had ischemic etiology, and 67.3\% had HF with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45\% versus {$>$}45\% [HF with preserved ejection fraction]). Overall, 10-year mortality was 98.8\%, with 35 966 hospital readmissions occurring over the lifetime of the cohort. Adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) for first cardiovascular hospitalization were 1.36 for ischemic HF (95\% CI, 1.28–1.44; P{$<$}0.001), 1.10 for HF with reduced ejection fraction (95\% CI; 1.00–1.20; P=0.045), and 1.00 for men (95\% CI, 0.94–1.06; P=0.979). On repeated-events time-to-event analysis, ischemic HF was a predictor of cardiovascular (HR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.18–1.29), HF (HR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.13–1.27), and coronary heart disease (HR, 2.01; 95\% CI, 1.81–2.24) hospitalizations (all P{$<$}0.001). Of all recurrent HF hospitalizations, 26.8\% occurred in the first and 39.8\% in the last deciles of cohort survival duration. Similarly, 29.7\% and 52.3\% of all cardiovascular readmissions occurred in the first and last deciles of the cohort survival duration, respectively. Conclusions Among newly discharged patients with HF, cardiovascular events were clustered at early postdischarge and prefatal time periods, and were increased among those with ischemic etiology.},

Age was not associated with disease-specific survival in young adults, but in older adults, 1-year increases in age elevated the relative hazard of HD death by 4–6\%. Male sex was related to outcome in young but not older adults, and Ann Arbor stage and B-symptom status exhibited markedly different relationships to survival by age. Older adult patients with and without B-symptoms had different hazards of mortality and had to be assessed separately.Conclusions: Factors associated with disease-specific survival were different for young and older adults with HD. These findings provide further support for two etiologically and clinically distinct disease entities.},

Design This was a follow up study that included incident cases of colorectal cancer from the Seattle Colon CFR. Cases were ages 20–74, diagnosed from 1997–2002, and were identified using the population-based Puget Sound SEER registry. Detailed information on history of NSAID use, including type, recency, and duration, was collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Follow-up for mortality was completed through linkages to the National Death Index (NDI). The main outcome measure was death due to colorectal cancer after diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the relationship between pre-diagnostic NSAID use and colorectal cancer-specific mortality among cases. Results NSAID use prior to colorectal cancer diagnosis was associated with an approximately 20\% lower rate of colorectal cancer mortality after diagnosis compared to never use (HR: 0.79; 95\% CI 0.65–0.97). This relationship appeared to be duration-dependent, with longer reported use prior to diagnosis associated with lower rates of colorectal cancer mortality among cases. The most pronounced reductions in mortality were observed among cases diagnosed with proximal disease (HR: 0.55; 95\% CI 0.37–0.82), whereas we observed no association between NSAID use prior to diagnosis and colorectal cancer-specific mortality among cases diagnosed with distal or rectal disease. Conclusions Our findings suggest that regular use of NSAIDs prior to diagnosis is associated with improved colorectal cancer survival, particularly among cases diagnosed with proximal disease and in longer-term NSAID users.},

Persistent regional and international differences in survival represent many avoidable deaths. Differences in survival have prompted or guided cancer control strategies. This is the first study in a programme to investigate international survival disparities, with the aim of informing health policy to raise standards and reduce inequalities in survival.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Data from population-based cancer registries in 12 jurisdictions in six countries were provided for 2·4 million adults diagnosed with primary colorectal, lung, breast (women), or ovarian cancer during 1995–2007, with follow-up to Dec 31, 2007. Data quality control and analyses were done centrally with a common protocol, overseen by external experts. We estimated 1-year and 5-year relative survival, constructing 252 complete life tables to control for background mortality by age, sex, and calendar year. We report age-specific and age-standardised relative survival at 1 and 5 years, and 5-year survival conditional on survival to the first anniversary of diagnosis. We also examined incidence and mortality trends during 1985–2005.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Relative survival improved during 1995–2007 for all four cancers in all jurisdictions. Survival was persistently higher in Australia, Canada, and Sweden, intermediate in Norway, and lower in Denmark, England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, particularly in the first year after diagnosis and for patients aged 65 years and older. International differences narrowed at all ages for breast cancer, from about 9\% to 5\% at 1 year and from about 14\% to 8\% at 5 years, but less or not at all for the other cancers. For colorectal cancer, the international range narrowed only for patients aged 65 years and older, by 2–6\% at 1 year and by 2–3\% at 5 years.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Up-to-date survival trends show increases but persistent differences between countries. Trends in cancer incidence and mortality are broadly consistent with these trends in survival. Data quality and changes in classification are not likely explanations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that physiologic pacing (dual-chamber or atrial) may be superior to single-chamber (ventricular) pacing because it is associated with lower risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and death. These benefits have not been evaluated in a large, randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: At 32 Canadian centers, patients without chronic atrial fibrillation who were scheduled for a first implantation of a pacemaker to treat symptomatic bradycardia were eligible for enrollment. We randomly assigned patients to receive either a ventricular pacemaker or a physiologic pacemaker and followed them for an average of three years. The primary outcome was stroke or death due to cardiovascular causes. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, atrial fibrillation, and hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: A total of 1474 patients were randomly assigned to receive a ventricular pacemaker and 1094 to receive a physiologic pacemaker. The annual rate of stroke or death due to cardiovascular causes was 5.5 percent with ventricular pacing, as compared with 4.9 percent with physiologic pacing (reduction in relative risk, 9.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -10.5 to 25.7 percent [the negative value indicates an increase in risk]; P=0.33). The annual rate of atrial fibrillation was significantly lower among the patients in the physiologic-pacing group (5.3 percent) than among those in the ventricular-pacing group (6.6 percent), for a reduction in relative risk of 18.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 32.6 percent; P=0.05). The effect on the rate of atrial fibrillation was not apparent until two years after implantation. The observed annual rates of death from all causes and of hospitalization for heart failure were lower among the patients with a physiologic pacemaker than among those with a ventricular pacemaker, but not significantly so (annual rates of death, 6.6 percent with ventricular pacing and 6.3 percent with physiologic pacing; annual rates of hospitalization for heart failure, 3.5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively). There were significantly more perioperative complications with physiologic pacing than with ventricular pacing (9.0 percent vs. 3.8 percent, P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Physiologic pacing provides little benefit over ventricular pacing for the prevention of stroke or death due to cardiovascular causes.},

  abstract = {Objective Barrett's oesophagus (BE) increases the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma by 10–55 times that of the general population, but no community-based cancer-specific incidence and cause-specific mortality risk estimates exist for large cohorts in the USA. Design Within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), we identified patients with BE diagnosed during 1995–2012. KPNC cancer registry and mortality files were used to estimate standardised incidence ratios (SIR), standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and excess absolute risks. Results There were 8929 patients with BE providing 50 147 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the greater KPNC population, patients with BE had increased risks of any cancer (SIR=1.40, 95\% CI 1.31 to 1.49), which slightly decreased after excluding oesophageal cancer. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk was increased 24 times, which translated into an excess absolute risk of 24 cases per 10 000 person-years. Although oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk decreased with time since BE diagnosis, oesophageal cancer mortality did not, indicating that the true risk is stable and persistent with time. Relative risks of cardia and stomach cancers were increased, but excess absolute risks were modest. Risks of colorectal, lung and prostate cancers were unaltered. All-cause mortality was slightly increased after excluding oesophageal cancer (SMR=1.24, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.31), but time-stratified analyses indicated that this was likely attributable to diagnostic bias. Cause-specific SMRs were elevated for ischaemic heart disease (SMR=1.39, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.63), respiratory system diseases (SMR=1.51, 95\% CI 1.29 to 1.75) and digestive system diseases (SMR=2.20 95\% CI 1.75 to 2.75). Conclusions Patients with BE had a persistent excess risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma over time, although their absolute excess risks for this cancer, any cancer and overall mortality were modest.},

  abstract = {Background: There are very few prospective follow-up studies of Barrett esophagus (BE) cohorts assessing the risk of extraesophageal cancer incidence or mortality. Such studies are necessary in order to understand the overall risks of cancer and death experienced by patients with BE. Methods: A cohort of 502 patients with BE were identified at Leeds General Infirmary, England. Mortality and cancer incidence information were provided by the Office for National Statistics. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated using indirect standardization. Results: All-cause mortality was found to be elevated in patients with BE [SMR, 1.21; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 1.06, 1.37] and remained so after esophageal cancers were excluded (SMR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.32). Increased mortality risks were also found for malignant neoplasms of the esophagus (SMR, 7.26; 95\% CI, 3.87-12.42) and diseases of the digestive system (SMR, 2.03; 95\% CI, 1.11-3.40). The remaining disease categories produced no altered risk estimates. Circulatory disease mortality was borderline statistically significant (SMR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.52; P = 0.053) for those with a specialized intestinal metaplasia diagnosis of BE. In the cancer incidence analyses, esophageal malignancies (SIR, 8.66; 95\% CI, 4.73-14.53) and esophageal adenocarcinomas (SIR, 14.29; 95\% CI, 7.13-22.56) were found to be increased in BE. All remaining analyses provided unaltered risks, including that of colorectal cancer. Conclusions: This study has shown evidence of an increased risk of esophageal cancer incidence and mortality in BE. It has also shown that those who have a histologic BE diagnosis may also have an increased risk of circulatory disease mortality. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(10):2090–6)},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Alcohol has been implicated in the development of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in 60\%–90\% of patients, although percentages in the United States are unknown. We investigated the epidemiology of alcohol-related CP at tertiary US referral centers. Methods We studied data from CP patients (n = 539) and controls (n = 695) enrolled in the North American Pancreatitis Study-2 from 2000 to 2006 at 20 US referral centers. CP was defined by definitive evidence from imaging or histologic analyses. Subjects and physicians each completed a study questionnaire. Using physician-assigned diagnoses, patients were assigned to an etiology group: alcohol (with/without other diagnoses), nonalcohol (any etiology of CP from other than alcohol), or idiopathic (no etiology identified). Results The distribution of patients among etiology groups was: alcohol (44.5\%), nonalcohol (26.9\%), and idiopathic (28.6\%). Physicians identified alcohol as the etiology more frequently in men (59.4\% men vs 28.1\% women), but nonalcohol (18\% men vs 36.7\% women) and idiopathic etiologies (22.6\% men vs 35.2\% women) more often in women (P {$<$} .01 for all comparisons). Nonalcohol etiologies were equally divided among obstructive, genetic, and other causes. Compared with controls, patients with idiopathic CP were more likely to have ever smoked (58.6\% vs 49.7\%, P {$<$} .05) or have a history of chronic renal disease or failure (5.2\% vs 1.2\%, P {$<$} .01). In multivariate analyses, smoking (ever, current, and amount) was independently associated with idiopathic CP. Conclusions The frequency of alcohol-related CP at tertiary US referral centers is lower than expected. Idiopathic CP and nonalcohol etiologies represent a large subgroup, particularly among women. Smoking is an independent risk factor for idiopathic CP.},

  abstract = {Objectives This paper describes the development of the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (CHIC) Study. The aim of the study is to collate routinely collected data on HIV-infected individuals attending one of seven clinical centres in the UK since 1 January 1996, with the objectives of describing changes over time in the frequency of AIDS-defining illnesses, describing the uptake of and response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and identifying factors associated with virological and immunological responses to HAART. Methods By December 2002, demographic, clinical and laboratory data had been collected on HIV-positive patients seen at six of the seven HIV centres. Missing and inconsistent data had been investigated and the datasets audited. Records identified as relating to the same patient had been merged, and cross-checks made with UK death registers to improve the accuracy of death reporting. Results The cohort currently contains information on 13 833 individuals. Eighty-two per cent of the cohort are male, and the median age was 34 years at first follow-up. The main risk factors for HIV infection have been determined as sex between men (63\%) and sex between men and women (24\%). Twenty-five per cent of the cohort are known to have developed AIDS, and 8\% have died. Conclusions The UK CHIC Study provides important information on the status of individuals infected with HIV in the UK, and provides a means to study the response to HAART and to monitor changes in the clinical event and death rates that have occurred since the introduction of HAART in the UK.},

  abstract = {Since the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) life expectancy has dramatically improved in HIV-infected individuals and approaches normal. In addition to people ageing with HIV, newly diagnosed infections are increasing in the over-50s. As a result, the proportion of individuals with HIV aged over 50 has increased significantly. There is a perspective that HIV infection may accelerate the ageing process and it has been shown that co-morbidity prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is in line with the general population who are 10–15 years older. Whether this finding is true, or whether it can be explained simply by lifestyle factors and co-infections remains the subject of ongoing research. Older people derive substantial benefit from cART but it is not clear whether CD4+ T-cell thresholds for starting cART should be higher or whether the increased occurrence of cART-associated toxicities in older people offsets any benefit. We explore in more depth the occurrence and management of age-related co-morbidities including cardiovascular, bone, renal diseases, metabolic disturbances and frailty. We suggest ways to screen for non-AIDS co-morbidity and control modifiable risk factors in the clinic setting. HIV care becomes more complex as people age and management in a multidisciplinary team is the best way to optimize the physical and emotional well-being of older people living with HIV.},

To facilitate treatment decision support for individual patients, accurate statistical models to predict locoregional relapse (LRR), distant relapse (DR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) are required. Methods and Materials Clinical trial data from the randomized Post Operative Radiation Therapy for Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC-1; N=714 patients) and PORTEC-2 (N=427 patients) trials and registered group (grade 3 and deep invasion, n=99) were pooled for analysis (N=1240). For most patients (86\%) pathology review data were available; otherwise original pathology data were used. Trial variables which were clinically relevant and eligible according to data constraints were age, stage, given treatment (pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), or no adjuvant treatment, FIGO histological grade, depth of invasion, and lymph-vascular invasion (LVSI). Multivariate analyses were based on Cox proportional hazards regression model. Predictors were selected based on a backward elimination scheme. Model results were expressed by the c-index (0.5-1.0; random to perfect prediction). Two validation sets (n=244 and 291 patients) were used. Results Accuracy of the developed models was good, with training accuracies between 0.71 and 0.78. The nomograms validated well for DR (0.73), DFS (0.69), and OS (0.70), but validation was only fair for LRR (0.59). Ranking of variables as to their predictive power showed that age, tumor grade, and LVSI were highly predictive for all outcomes, and given treatment for LRR and DFS. The nomograms were able to significantly distinguish low- from high-probability patients for these outcomes. Conclusions The nomograms are internally validated and able to accurately predict long-term outcome for endometrial cancer patients with observation, pelvic EBRT, or VBT after surgery. These models facilitate decision support in daily clinical practice and can be used for patient counseling and shared decision making, selecting patients who benefit most from adjuvant treatment, and generating new hypotheses.},

We provide an updated, integrated overview of the epidemiology of PAD, a focused literature review was conducted on the epidemiology of PAD. The PAD results were grouped into symptoms, diagnosis, prevalence, and incidence both in the United States and globally, risk factors, progression, coprevalence with other atherosclerotic disease, and association with incident cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The most common symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication, but noninvasive measures, such as the ankle-brachial index, show that asymptomatic PAD is several times more common in the population than intermittent claudication. PAD prevalence and incidence are both sharply age-related, rising {$>$}10\% among patients in their 60s and 70s. With aging of the global population, it seems likely that PAD will be increasingly common in the future. Prevalence seems to be higher among men than women for more severe or symptomatic disease. The major risk factors for PAD are similar to those for coronary and cerebrovascular disease, with some differences in the relative importance of factors. Smoking is a particularly strong risk factor for PAD, as is diabetes mellitus, and several newer risk markers have shown independent associations with PAD. PAD is strongly associated with concomitant coronary and cerebrovascular diseases. After adjustment for known cardiovascular disease risk factors, PAD is associated with an increased risk of incident coronary and cerebrovascular disease morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Deaths in HIV-positive people have decreased since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996. Fewer AIDS-related deaths and an ageing cohort have resulted in an increase in the proportion of HIV patients dying from non-AIDS-related disorders. Here we describe mortality and causes of death in people diagnosed with HIV in the HAART era compared with the general population. Methods In this observational analysis, we linked cohort data collected by Public Health England (PHE) for individuals aged 15 years and older, diagnosed with HIV in England and Wales from 1997 to 2012, to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) national mortality register. Cohort inclusion began at diagnosis with follow-up clinical information collected every year from all 220 National Health Service (NHS) HIV outpatient clinics nationwide. To classify causes of death we used a modified Coding Causes of Death in HIV (CoDe) protocol, which uses death certificate data and clinical markers. We applied Kaplan-Meier analysis for survival curves and mortality rate estimation and Cox regression to establish independent predictors of all-cause mortality, adjusting for sex, infection route, age at diagnosis, region of birth, year of diagnosis, late diagnosis, and history of HAART. We used standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to make comparisons with the general population. Findings Between 1997 and 2012, 88\hphantom{,}994 people were diagnosed with HIV, contributing 448\hphantom{,}839 person-years of follow up. By the end of 2012, 5302 (6\%) patients had died (all-cause mortality 118 per 10\hphantom{,}000 person-years, 95\% CI 115–121). In multivariable analysis, late diagnosis was a strong predictor of death (hazard ratio [HR] 3·50, 95\% CI 3·13–3·92). People diagnosed more recently had a lower risk of death (2003–07: HR 0·66, 95\% CI 0·62–0·70; 2008–12: HR 0·65, 95\% CI 0·60–0·71). Cause of death was determinable for 4808 (91\%) of 5302 patients; most deaths (2791 [58\%] of 4808) were attributable to AIDS-defining illnesses. Cohort mortality was significantly higher than the general population for all causes (SMR 5·7, 95\% CI 5·5–5·8), particularly non-AIDS infections (10·8, 9·8–12·0) and liver disease (3·7, 3·3–4·2). All-cause mortality was highest in the year after diagnosis (SMR 24·3, 95\% CI 23·4–25·2). Interpretation Despite the availability of free treatment and care in the UK, AIDS continues to account for the majority of deaths in HIV-positive people, and mortality remains higher in HIV-positive people than in the general population. These findings highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis, care engagement, and optimum management of comorbidities in reducing mortality in people with HIV. Funding Public Health England.},

The authors used outpatient and inpatient data for a national population to examine the association between schizophrenia and mortality and comorbidities.MethodThis was a national cohort study of 6,097,834 Swedish adults, including 8,277 with schizophrenia, followed for 7 years (2003–2009) for mortality and comorbidities diagnosed in any outpatient or inpatient setting nationwide.ResultsOn average, men with schizophrenia died 15 years earlier, and women 12 years earlier, than the rest of the population, and this was not accounted for by unnatural deaths. The leading causes were ischemic heart disease and cancer. Despite having twice as many health care system contacts, schizophrenia patients had no increased risk of nonfatal ischemic heart disease or cancer diagnoses, but they had an elevated mortality from ischemic heart disease (adjusted hazard ratio for women, 3.33 [95\% CI=2.73–4.05]; for men, 2.20 [95\% CI=1.83–2.65]) and cancer (adjusted hazard ratio for women, 1.71 [95\% CI=1.38–2.10; for men, 1.44 [95\% CI=1.15–1.80]). Among all people who died from ischemic heart disease or cancer, schizophrenia patients were less likely than others to have been diagnosed previously with these conditions (for ischemic heart disease, 26.3\% compared with 43.7\%; for cancer, 73.9\% compared with 82.3\%). The association between schizophrenia and mortality was stronger among women and the employed. Lack of antipsychotic treatment was also associated with elevated mortality.ConclusionsSchizophrenia patients had markedly premature mortality, and the leading causes were ischemic heart disease and cancer, which appeared to be underdiagnosed. Preventive interventions should prioritize primary health care tailored to this population, including more effective risk modification and screening for cardiovascular disease and cancer.},

  abstract = {Mental disorders are associated with premature mortality, and the magnitudes of risk have commonly been estimated using hospital data. However, psychiatric patients who are hospitalized have more severe illness and do not adequately represent mental disorders in the general population. We conducted a national cohort study using outpatient and inpatient diagnoses for the entire Swedish adult population (N~=~7,253,516) to examine the extent to which mortality risks are overestimated using inpatient diagnoses only. Outcomes were all-cause and suicide mortality during 8 years of follow-up (2001–2008). There were 377,339 (5.2\%) persons with any inpatient psychiatric diagnosis, vs. 680,596 (9.4\%) with any inpatient or outpatient diagnosis, hence 44.6\% of diagnoses were missed using inpatient data only. When including and accounting for prevalent psychiatric cases, all-cause mortality risk among persons with any mental disorder was overestimated by 15.3\% using only inpatient diagnoses (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 5.89; 95\% CI, 5.85–5.92) vs. both inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (aHR, 5.11; 95\% CI, 5.08–5.14). Suicide risk was overestimated by 18.5\% (aHRs, 23.91 vs. 20.18), but this varied widely by specific disorders, from 4.4\% for substance use to 49.1\% for anxiety disorders. The sole use of inpatient diagnoses resulted in even greater overestimation of all-cause or suicide mortality risks when prevalent cases were unidentified (∼20–30\%) or excluded (∼25–40\%). However, different methods for handling prevalent cases resulted in only modest variation in risk estimates when using both inpatient and outpatient diagnoses. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of hospital-based studies and the design of future studies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of smoking with death in HIV infected subjects. Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis within the Ontario HIV Treatment Network Cohort Study (OCS). The OCS is a prospective multi-centre cohort database. We analyzed subjects 18 years of age or older, and examined the association between smoking status and subsequent mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Thirty-two hundred and ten OCS subjects were diagnosed as HIV positive at a mean (SD) age of 35 (9) years between 1980 and 2007. Mean (SD) follow-up was 10 (5) years and 32,998 person-years were observed. There were 2,791 (87\%) men and 2,531 (79\%) were white. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was used by 2,933 (91\%) subjects. Mean (SD) baseline CD4 T-lymphocytes count was 344 (253) 109 cells/ml. One thousand and nineteen (32\%) subjects used street drugs. Annual smoking prevalence was 67-69\% between 1995 and 2001, and then decreased gradually to 60\% in 2007. Six hundred and forty-five (20\%) subjects died between 1995 and 2007. The annual mortality rate was 2.1\% in 1995, peaked at 5.5\% in 1996, dropped to 3.2\% in 1997, and then decreased to 0.9\% in 2007. There was a statistically significant interaction between smoking and suppressed viral load in predicting death (p=0.008). In 1,865 (58\%) subjects who had undetectable viral load at least once, smokers had a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 2.4 (95\% confidence interval [CI]) 1.1, 5.2) for current versus never smokers, after controlling for age at HIV diagnosis, sex, race, HAART use, baseline CD4 count and substance use. Former smokers had an HR of 2.3 (0.9, 5.9) versus never-smokers. Conclusions: In HIV infected subjects, current smokers were at higher risk of death comparing to non-smokers, while former smokers may be at higher risk. High smoking prevalence in HIV infected subjects highlighted the importance of smoking cessation program specially designed for them.}

The Busselton analysis used subjects free of probable and suspect coronary heart disease at onset.

Cholesterol was unrelated to mortality in women but showed negative relationship with cancer in 60-74 yr old men. In total mortality, smoking in men and women, and obesity in women were significant risk factors; 1 hr serum insulin had a negative relationship in men aged 40-59 yr, and a stronger positive relationship in men aged 60-74 yr, but this may have been due to the close negative association of the variable with body size (i.e. height).

Population-based data regarding short-term outcomes and recurrence after endoscopic treatment for esophageal cancer are limited. We compared short-term outcomes, treated recurrence, and survival after endoscopic versus surgical therapy for early esophageal cancers in an older population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study identifying patients aged~≥66 years with Tis or T1a tumors without nodal involvement diagnosed from 1994 to 2011 from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Of 2193 patients, 41\% (n~= 893) underwent esophagectomy, and 12\% (n~= 255) underwent endoscopic treatment within 6 months of diagnosis. Those treated endoscopically were older and more likely to have a Charlson comorbidity score~≥2. A composite endpoint, hospitalization and/or adverse events at 60 days,~was higher in surgical patients than in the endoscopic treatment group (30\% vs 12\%; P~{$<$} .001). In a Cox model stratified by histology, adjusting for other factors, endoscopic treatment was associated with improved 2-year survival (hazard ratio 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.36-0.73). In this older population, a composite short-term endpoint was worse in the surgical group. Endoscopic treatment was associated with improved survival through 2 years. These results suggest that endoscopic treatment is a reasonable approach for early esophageal cancers in the elderly.},

  abstract = {Context: The safety of insulin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has recently undergone scrutiny. Objective: The objective of the study was to characterize the risk of adverse events associated with glucose-lowering therapies in people with T2DM. Design and Setting: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from the UK General Practice Research Database, 2000-2010. Patients: Patients comprised 84 622 primary care patients with T2DM treated with one of five glucose-lowering regimens: metformin monotherapy, sulfonylurea monotherapy, insulin monotherapy, metformin plus sulfonylurea combination therapy, and insulin plus metformin combination therapy. There were 105 123 exposure periods. Main Outcome Measures: The risk of the first major adverse cardiac event, first cancer, or mortality was measured. Secondary outcomes included these individual constituents and microvascular complications. Results: In thesamemodel, andusing metformin monotherapy as the referent, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for the primary end point was significantly increased for sulfonylurea monotherapy (1.436, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.354-1.523), insulin monotherapy (1.808, 95\% CI 1.630-2.005), and insulin plus metformin (1.309, 95\% CI 1.150-1.491). In glycosylated hemoglobin/morbidity subgroups, patients treated with insulin monotherapy had aHRs for the primary outcome ranging from 1.469 (95\% CI 0.978-2.206) to 2.644 (95\% CI 1.896-3.687). For all secondary outcomes, insulin monotherapy had increased aHRs: myocardial infarction (1.954, 95\% CI 1.479-2.583), major adverse cardiac events (1.736, 95\% CI 1.441-2.092), stroke (1.432, 95\% CI 1.159-1.771), renal complications (3.504, 95\% CI 2.718-4.518), neuropathy (2.146, 95\% CI 1.832-2.514), eye complications (1.171, 95\% CI 1.057-1.298), cancer (1.437, 95\% CI 1.234-1.674), or all-cause mortality (2.197, 95\% CI 1.983-2.434). When compared directly, aHRs were higher for insulin monotherapy vs all other regimens for the primary end point and all-cause mortality. Conclusions: In people with T2DM, exogenous insulin therapy was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related complications, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Differences in baseline characteristics between treatment groups should be considered when interpreting these results. Copyright © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.},

The purpose of this study is to assess the associations between diabetes complications and mortality in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the 3,711 subjects enrolled in the ETDRS, a randomized controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the role of laser photocoagulation and aspirin therapy for diabetic retinopathy. The outcome assessed was all-cause mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess associations between diabetes complications and mortality for type 1 and type 2 diabetes separately. RESULTS: The 5-year estimates of all-cause mortality were 5.5 and 18.9\% for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In patients with type 1 diabetes, amputation (hazard ratio [HR] 5.08 [95\% CI 2.06-12.54]) and poor visual acuity (1.74 [1.10-2.75]) remained significantly associated with mortality, after adjusting for other diabetes complications and baseline characteristics. In patients with type 2 diabetes, macrovascular disease and worsening levels of nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and visual acuity are associated with progressively increasing risks of mortality, after controlling for other baseline risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Amputation is the strongest predictor for mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes. All complications independently predict mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. There is an increased risk for mortality as the degree of each complication worsens. Additional studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of tertiary prevention to decrease mortality in these patients.},

We reviewed current data and assessed the benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population.MethodsThe effect of aspirin for site-specific cancer incidence and mortality, cardiovascular events was collated from the most recent systematic reviews. Studies identified through systematic Medline search provided data regarding harmful effects of aspirin and baseline rates of harms like gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcer.ResultsThe effects of aspirin on cancer are not apparent until at least 3 years after the start of use, and some benefits are sustained for several years after cessation in long-term users. No differences between low and standard doses of aspirin are observed, but there were no direct comparisons. Higher doses do not appear to confer additional benefit but increase toxicities. Excess bleeding is the most important harm associated with aspirin use, and its risk and fatality rate increases with age. For average-risk individuals aged 50–65 years taking aspirin for 10 years, there would be a relative reduction of between 7\% (women) and 9\% (men) in the number of cancer, myocardial infarction or stroke events over a 15-year period and an overall 4\% relative reduction in all deaths over a 20-year period.ConclusionsProphylactic aspirin use for a minimum of 5 years at doses between 75 and 325 mg/day appears to have favourable benefit–harm profile; longer use is likely to have greater benefits. Further research is needed to determine the optimum dose and duration of use, to identify individuals at increased risk of bleeding, and to test effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori screening–eradication before starting aspirin prophylaxis.},

The main outcomes were CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for CHF, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: During the 4.5-year follow-up, 658 had a CVD death, 1018 a myocardial infarction, 364 a stroke, 297 a CHF event, and 1034 died. When compared with the first tertile, the third tertile of BMI increased the adjusted relative risk (RR) of myocardial infarction by 20\% (P {$<$} .02).

DESIGN AND SETTING: A national sample of 11 247 Australians aged {$>$} or =25 years was examined in 2000 in a cross-sectional survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The examination included a fasting blood sample, standard 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, blood pressure measurements and questionnaires to assess treatment for dyslipidaemia and hypertension. BMI, waist circumference and WHR were measured to assess overweight and obesity. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity amongst Australian adults defined by BMI, waist circumference and WHR was 20.8, 30.5 and 15.8\% respectively. The unadjusted odds ratio for the fourth vs. first quartile of each obesity measurement showed that WHR had the strongest relationship with type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia (women only) and hypertension. Following adjustment for age, however, there was little difference between the three measures of obesity, with the possible exceptions of hypertension in women, where BMI had a stronger association, and dyslipidaemia in women and type 2 diabetes in men, where WHR was marginally superior. CONCLUSIONS: Waist circumference, BMI and WHR identified different proportions of the population, as measured by both prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Whilst WHR had the strongest correlations with CVD risk factors before adjustment for age, the three obesity measures performed similarly after adjustment for age. Given the difficulty of using age-adjusted associations in the clinical setting, these results suggest that given appropriate cut-off points, WHR is the most useful measure of obesity to use to identify individuals with CVD risk factors},

  abstract = {Background: Marital status has been implicated as a prognostic factor in bladder cancer survival. However, few studies have explored potential mechanisms through which this might occur. Methods: The study identified 19 982 bladder cancer patients from the SEER-Medicare database (1992–8) and constructed sex-specific Cox proportional hazard models to assess the relation between marital status and 5-year survival, while sequentially adding covariates to test possible mechanisms. Results: Multivariable Cox analyses suggest that at every stage, married men had better survival than unmarried men independent of age, race, ecologic socioeconomic status, comorbidities, any or aggressive treatment (assessed separately), and accessing a teaching hospital (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.87). Among women with stages II–IV bladder cancer, age and the presence of comorbid conditions explained the association between marital status and survival. However, among those diagnosed with stage I bladder cancer, none of the covariates explained the association between marital status and decreased mortality (fully adjusted HR 0.72; 95\% CI 0.62 to 0.84). Conclusion: The lack of evidence of mediation through treatment, overall health, SES, or quality of healthcare institution among married men and women with stage I disease suggests they may be benefiting from something other than these factors, perhaps practical or social support.},

This study estimated in-hospital mortality and medium and long-term survival. Methods This was a retrospective study of 78,806 patients who underwent heart valve surgery between 2001 and 2007 in Brazil. Two national databases were used, the Hospital Information System and the Mortality Information System. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were performed. Maximum and median follow-up was 7.7 and 2.8 years, respectively (0.002–7.707). Results Valve replacement accounted for 69.1\% of procedures performed. Mitral stenosis, the most common valve injury, represented 38.9\% of the total. In 94.7\% of mitral stenosis patients, aetiology was rheumatic heart disease. In-hospital mortality was 7.6\% and was higher for women, for patients who had undergone concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and for the elderly. Overall survival was 69.9\% at the end of follow-up. Survival was worst among elderly, male and concomitant CABG patients (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions Rheumatic heart disease is still a major public health problem in Brazil. In-hospital mortality and global survival rates of patients who have undergone heart valve surgery were less satisfactory than those reported in high-income countries. The findings of this study can contribute to guiding decision making processes in middle-income countries similar to Brazil and others concerned with improving the quality of care.},

The aim of this cohort study is to compare all-cause mortality between all PLHIV, successfully treated PLHIV, and HIV-negative control persons from the general population and to explore the impact of viral load (VL) at diagnosis. A total of 4066 PLHIV were matched against 8072 HIVnegative controls according to age, sex, and region of birth. Further, associations between VL at diagnosis, time on treatment, treatment outcome, and mortality were assessed over a 15-year period. Cox regression estimates were computed to compare the overall crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality. After a 15-year follow-up period, successfully treated PLHIV were found to be three times more likely to die when compared with HIVnegative controls (HR 3.01, 95\% CI 2.05–4.44, p {$<$} 0.001). The risk of mortality decreased from HR 6.02 after the first year of successful treatment. VL {$>$}30,000 c/mL at diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of mortality despite long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment. Although effective viral suppression has led to significant increases in longevity and quality of life, ART has not fully restored life expectancy to a level comparable with that found in HIV-negative persons. Even when PLHIV are successfully treated, there are several other important areas related to death, such as smoking and social factors, where data are still missing.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE-To develop and validate a parsimonious model for predicting short-term allcause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Two cohorts of patients with T2DM were investigated. The Gargano Mortality Study (GMS, n = 679 patients) was the training set and the Foggia Mortality Study (FMS, n = 936 patients) represented the validation sample.GMS and FMS cohorts were prospectively followed up for 7.40±2.15 and 4.51±1.69 years, respectively, and all-cause mortality was registered. A new forward variable selection within a multivariate Cox regression was implemented. Starting from the empty model, each step selected the predictor that, once included into the multivariate Cox model, yielded the maximum continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI). The selection procedure stopped when no further statistically significant cNRI increase was detected. RESULTS-Nine variables (age, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and antihypertensive and insulin therapy) were included in the final predictive model with a C statistic of 0.88 (95\% CI 0.82-0.94) in the GMS and 0.82 (0.76-0.87) in the FMS. Finally, we used a recursive partition and amalgamation algorithm to identify patients at intermediate and high mortality risk (hazard ratio 7.0 and 24.4, respectively, as compared with those at low risk). A web-based risk calculator was also developed. CONCLUSIONS-We developed and validated a parsimonious all-cause mortality equation in T2DM, providing also a user-friendly web-based risk calculator. Our model may help prioritize the use of available resources for targeting aggressive preventive and treatment strategies in a subset of very high-risk individuals. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.},

The BRAF V600E mutation has been associated with worse survival in MSS CRC. This mutation occurs in 40\% of MSI CRC and it is unclear whether it confers worse survival in this setting. The prognostic value of KRAS mutations in both MSS and MSI CRC remains unclear. We examined the effect of BRAF and KRAS mutations on survival in stage II and III MSI colon cancer patients. BRAF exon 15 and KRAS exon 2–3 mutation status was assessed in 143 stage II (n\,=\,85) and III (n\,=\,58) MSI colon cancers by high resolution melting analysis and sequencing. The relation between mutation status and cancer-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. BRAF V600E mutations were observed in 51\% (n\,=\,73) and KRAS mutations in 16\% of cases (n\,=\,23). Patients with double wild-type cancers (dWT; i.e., BRAF and KRAS wild-type) had a highly favourable survival with 5-year CSS of 93\% (95\% CI 84–100\%), while patients with cancers harbouring mutations in either BRAF or KRAS, had 5-year CSS of 76\% (95\% CI 67–85\%). In the subgroup of stage II patients with dWT cancers no cancer-specific deaths were observed. On multivariate analysis, mutation in either BRAF or KRAS vs. dWT remained significantly prognostic. Mutations in BRAF as well as KRAS should be analyzed when considering these genes as prognostic markers in MSI colon cancers.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 1246 consecutive patients with left ventricular dysfunction. All patients had a cardiopulmonary exercise test and an echocardiogram. Cardiac catheterisation was systematically performed to define HF aetiology. Twenty-two percent of the patients were diabetic (hypoglycaemic drugs or fasting blood glucose {$>$}126 mg/dL); in diabetic patients, HF aetiology was ischaemic in 58\% vs. 40\% in non-diabetic patients ( p {$<$} 0.0001). Clinical follow-up (median 1200 days) was obtained for 1241 patients. There was a statistically significant effect of diabetes mellitus on cardiac survival that differed according to HF aetiology (interaction p {$>$} 0.01). Diabetes mellitus was an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in ischaemic patients (HR=1.54 [1.13; 2.09]; P = 0.006) but not in non-ischaemic patients (HR=0.65 [0.39; 1.07];p = 0.09). When diabetic patients were defined as patients receiving hypoglycaemic drugs at baseline, diabetes mellitus remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in ischaemic patients (HR=1.43 [1.03; 1.98]; p = 0.03) while diabetes mellitus was associated with a statistically significant decrease in cardiovascular mortality in non-ischaemic patients (HR=0.46 [0.23; 0.88]; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The prognostic impact of diabetes mellitus in HF patients is markedly influenced by the underlying aetiology and is particularly deleterious in those with ischaemic cardiomyopathy.},

Methods and Results We used the Danish Stroke Registry, with information on all hospital admissions for stroke in Denmark between 2003 and 2012 (N=79~617), and the Danish Register of Causes of Death. Information was available on age, sex, marital status, stroke severity, stroke subtype, socioeconomic status, and cardiovascular risk profile. We studied only deaths due to the index stroke, with the assumption that death reported on death certificates as due to stroke was related to the index stroke if death occurred within the first week or month after stroke. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and multiple imputation were applied. Stroke was the cause of death for 4373 and 5512 of the 79~617 patients within 1~week (5.5\%) or 1~month (6.9\%), respectively. After the age of 60~years, women had more severe strokes than men. Up to ages in the mid-60s, no difference in the risk of death from stroke was seen between the 2 sexes. For people aged {$>$}65~years, however, the risk gradually became greater in men than in women and significantly so ({$>$}15\%) from the mid-70s (adjusted for age, marital status, stroke severity, stroke subtype, socioeconomic status, and cardiovascular risk factors). Results were essentially the same when analyzing deaths within 1~week, 1 month and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke separately. Conclusions Stroke affects women and men differently.

In this study, we assessed the mortality risk of PEI in patients with CP. STUDY: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted in patients with CP under long-term follow-up. CP and PEI were diagnosed using pancreatic imaging and the C-labeled mixed triglyceride breath test, respectively. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of PEI and other clinical features on mortality risk. RESULTS: Patients (N=430) were analyzed (79.1\% male; mean age, 47.8\,y) during a mean follow-up of 8.6±4.6 years. PEI prevalence was 29.3\% and mortality was 10.9\%. Most frequent causes of death were cancer (40.4\%), infection (21.3\%), and acute cardiovascular event (14.9\%). Multivariate analyses showed associations between increased mortality and presence of PEI [hazard ratio (HR), 2.59; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-4.71; P{$<$}0.003], liver cirrhosis (HR, 3.87; 95\% CI, 1.95-7.69; P{$<$}0.001), age at diagnosis (HR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.09; P{$<$}0.001), toxic etiology of CP (HR, 3.11; 95\% CI, 1.11-8.70; P{$<$}0.05) and respiratory comorbidity (HR, 2.19; 95\% CI, 1.12-4.31; P{$<$}0.03). Nutritional markers were significantly lower in patients with PEI versus those without PEI (P{$<$}0.001) and in those who died versus survivors (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PEI was a significant independent risk factor for mortality in patients with CP. These results support further research into the optimal treatment of PEI to reduce mortality in this population.},

This study aimed to provide precise estimates of the absolute and relative risks of dying in an unselected cohort of patients with a first-ever stroke. Six hundred seventy-five patients were registered by a community-based stroke register (the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project) and prospectively followed up for up to 6.5 years. Their relative risk of death was calculated using age- and sex-specific mortality rates for Oxfordshire. During the first 30 days, 129 (19\%) patients died. Patients who survived at least 30 days after a first-ever stroke thereafter had an average annual risk of death of 9.1\%, 2.3-fold the risk in people from the general population. Although the absolute (about 15\%) and relative (about threefold) risks of death were highest in these 30-day survivors over the first year after the stroke, they were at increased risk of dying over the next few years (range of relative risk for individual years, 1.1-2.9). Predictably, older patients had a worse absolute survival but, relative to the general population, stroke also increased the relative risk of dying in younger patients. During the first 30 days stroke accounts for most deaths; after this time nonstroke cardiovascular disease becomes increasingly important and is the most common cause of death after the first year. These data highlight the importance of long-term secondary prevention of vascular events in stroke patients, targeted as much at the cardiovascular as at the cerebrovascular circulation.},

The 5-year relative survival ratios in the last calendar period were 0.65, 0.58, 0.36, 0.15, 0.05, and 0.01 for the age groups 0 to 18, 19 to 40, 41 to 60, 61 to 70, 71 to 80, and 80+ years, respectively. Intensified chemotherapy, a continuous improvement in supportive care, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are probably the most important factors contributing to this finding. In contrast, there was no improvement in survival in AML patients with a prior diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome during 1993 to 2005 (n = 219). In conclusion, AML survival has improved during the last decades. However, the majority of AML patients die of their disease and age remains an important predictor of prognosis. New effective agents with a more favorable toxicity profile are needed to improve survival, particularly in the elderly.},

  abstract = {Background Cardiac involvement in the sarcoidosis is known to ensue with diverse clinical forms and its investigation is challenging at times. This article features the under-perceived burden, patterns, and outcomes of different arrhythmias, which may have a prognostic significance in patients with sarcoidosis. Methods We queried the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) for 2010–2014 to recognize sarcoidosis, arrhythmia, and comorbidities affecting hospitalizations. The nationwide estimates were attained using discharge records. We assessed incidence and trends in sarcoidosis-related arrhythmia and consequential inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), hospitalization charges and predictors of mortality with multivariate analysis. Results We identified 369,285 sarcoidosis-related hospitalizations. Of these, nearly one-fifth suffered from arrhythmias (n=73,424). The sarcoidosis patients developing arrhythmias were older (61.9 vs. 56.0 years) compared to those without. Males had the higher incidence of arrhythmias compared to females. Atrial fibrillation (Afib) (10.97\%) was the most common subtype, followed by ventricular tachycardia (1.97\%). There was a rising trend in arrhythmia-related hospital admissions and mortality among sarcoidosis, with Afib incidence displaying the highest increase. Traditional cardiac comorbidities were higher in the sarcoid-arrhythmia group. The arrhythmia group had significantly higher mortality (3.7\% vs. 1.5\%), mean hospital LOS (6.4 vs. 5.2 days) and hospital charges (\$64,118 vs. \$41,565) compared to non-arrhythmia group (P{$<$}0.001). Incident arrhythmia significantly increased the mortality odds in sarcoidosis (adjusted odds ratio, 2.06). Conclusions The growing trend, deteriorating outcomes and higher mortality associated with sarcoid-related arrhythmias highlight the importance of timely diagnosis and aggressive management in this population.},

DESIGN Meta analysis of literature data. SUBJECTS Populations of American Blacks, Caucasians, Chinese, Ethiopians, Indonesians, Polynesians and Thais. MEASUREMENTS Mean values of BMI, percent body fat, gender and age were adapted from original papers. RESULTS The relationship between percent body fat and BMI differs in the ethnic groups studied. For the same level of body fat, age and gender, American Blacks have a 1.3 kg/m2 and Polynesians a 4.5 kg/m2 lower BMI compared to Caucasians. By contrast, in Chinese, Ethiopians, Indonesians and Thais BMIs are 1.9, 4.6, 3.2 and 2.9 kg/m2 lower compared to Caucasians, respectively. Slight differences in the relationship between percent body fat and BMI of American Caucasians and European Caucasians were also found. The differences found in the body fat/BMI relationship in different ethnic groups could be due to differences in energy balance as well as to differences in body build. CONCLUSIONS The results show that the relationship between percent body fat and BMI is different among different ethnic groups. This should have public health implications for the definitions of BMI cut-off points for obesity, which would need to be population-specific.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic artery disease is a common condition in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, there are few published data on the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in nondialyzed patients with renal insufficiency. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a simple, noninvasive, and reliable method to assess PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prevalence of PAD using ABI was investigated in 102 patients referred for the first time to a nephrology clinic with CKD in stages 3 to 5 of the K/DOQI classification, and with no previous diagnosis of PAD. Patients with ABI {$<$}0.9 were considered positive for PAD. A total of 64\% of the patients were male. The mean age was 70 +/- 11 (range 58-84) years, and the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 35 +/- 12 (range 6-59) mL/min(-1). Of the total sample, 26\% were diabetics, 10\% active smokers, 48\% ex-smokers, and 29\% had a diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD), 15\% had been previously diagnosed of stroke, and 17\% had signs and symptoms compatible with intermittent claudication, which had passed unnoticed. Thirty-two percent of patients had an ABI {$<$}0.9 (mean 0.64 +/- 0.25). Of these patients with PAD, 84\% were men (P {$<$} 0.005), and only 30\% presented a clinical picture compatible with intermittent claudication. Absolute risk of CHD according to the Framingham 1998 score was higher in the PAD group (19.3\% +/- 6 vs. 13.1\% +/- 8; P= 0.01). Patients with PAD were older (75 +/- 6 vs. 66 +/- 11 years, P= 0.000), and had worse renal function (CrCl 30.8 +/- 12 vs. 37 +/- 10.7 mL.min(-1), P= 0.016) compared to patients without PAD, but no differences were found in cholesterol levels (total, HDL, LDL), calcium, phosphorus, or PTH. In the logistic regression analysis, independent indicators of PAD risk were male sex, age, and lower CrCl. Twelve percent of patients had an ABI {$>$} or =1.3, suggestive of parietal arterial calcifications. In these patients, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were lower (126 +/- 18 vs. 150 +/- 27, P= 0.005, and 52 +/- 13 vs. 68 +/- 25 mm Hg, P= 0.044), i-PTH levels were higher (228 +/- 267 vs. 117 +/- 63 pg/mL, P= 0.01), and a larger proportion of this group was treated with calcitriol (34\% vs. 13\%) compared to patients with a normal ABI. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of PAD, considered as an ABI {$<$}0.9, was demonstrated in nondialyzed patients with CKD. This was related with age, male sex, and higher degree of renal insufficiency, while the presence of ABI {$>$} or =1.3 was associated with a greater degree of hyperparathyroidism. These data show the need to carry out routine ABI determinations in patients with CKD for early detection of peripheral arterial disease.},

  abstract = {Background No recent attempt has been made to synthesise information on mortality and dementia despite the theoretical and practical interest in the topic. Our objective was to estimate the influence on mortality of cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods Data sources were Medline, Embase, personal files and colleagues' records. Studies were considered if they included a majority of persons aged 65 and over at baseline either drawn from a total community sample or drawn from a random sample from the community. Samples from health care facilities were excluded. The search located 68 community studies. Effect sizes were extracted from the studies and if they were not included in the published studies, effect sizes were calculated where possible: this was possible for 23 studies of cognitive impairment and 32 of dementia. No attempt was made to contact authors for missing data. Results For the studies of cognitive impairment Fisher's method (a vote counting method), gave a p-value (from eight studies) of 0.00001. For studies of dementia, age-adjusted confidence intervals (CI) were pooled (odds ratio (OR) 2.63 with 95\% CI 2.17 to 3.21 from six studies). Conclusions Levels of cognitive impairment commonly found in community studies give rise to an increased risk of mortality, and this appears to be true even for quite mild levels of impairment. The analysis confirms the increased risk of mortality for dementia, but reveals a dearth of information on the causes of the excess mortality and on possible effect modification by age, dementia subtype or other variables.

  abstract = {Background: COPD and asthma are common diseases in the U.S. population and can coexist. Our goal was to determine the prevalence of self-reported, physician-diagnosed asthma and COPD in a sample of the U.S. population and their association with lung function impairment and mortality. Methods: We used baseline data from NHANES III and the follow-up mortality data. We used logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, smoking status, and disease stage. Results: The sample consisted of 15,203 subjects, of whom 4,542 died during the follow-up period. Coexisting COPD and asthma was reported by 357 (2.7\%), COPD by 815 (5.3\%), and asthma by 709 (5.3\%). Subjects with both conditions had a higher proportion of obstruction (30.9\%) than those with COPD (24.3\%), asthma (13.3\%), or no lung disease (5.4\%). In survival models adjusting for all factors except baseline lung function, coexisting COPD and asthma had the highest risk for mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.83, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.34, 2.49), followed by COPD only (HR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.28, 1.62), and asthma only (HR 1.16, 95\% CI 0.94, 1.42). These affects were attenuated after controlling for baseline lung function: coexisting asthma and COPD (HR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.06, 1.98), COPD only (1.28, 95\% CI 1.13, 1.45), and asthma only (HR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.85, 1.27). Conclusion: In this analysis, subjects who report coexisting asthma and COPD have a higher risk of obstruction on spirometry and a higher risk of death during follow-up.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease mortality has declined and diabetes mortality has increased in high-income countries. We estimated the potential role of trends in population body mass index, systolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol and smoking in cardiometabolic mortality decline in 26 industrialized countries. METHODS: Mortality data were from national vital statistics. Body mass index, systolic blood pressure and serum total cholesterol were from a systematic analysis of population-based data. We estimated the associations between change in cardiometabolic mortality and changes in risk factors, adjusted for change in per-capita gross domestic product. We calculated the potential contribution of risk factor trends to mortality decline. RESULTS: Between 1980 and 2009, age-standardized cardiometabolic mortality declined in all 26 countries, with the annual decline between {$<$}1\% in Mexico to ≈ 5\% in Australia. Across the 26 countries together, risk factor trends may have accounted for ≈ 48\% (men) and ≈ 40\% (women) of cardiometabolic mortality decline. Risk factor trends may have accounted for {$>$}60\% of decline among men and women in Finland and Switzerland, men in New Zealand and France, and women in Italy; their benefits were smallest in Mexican, Portuguese, and Japanese men and Mexican women. Risk factor trends may have slowed down mortality decline in Chilean men and women and had virtually no effect in Argentinean women. The contributions of risk factors to mortality decline seemed substantially larger among men than among women in the USA, Canada and The Netherlands. CONCLUSIONS: Industrialized countries have varied widely in the extent of risk factor prevention, and its likely benefits for cardiometabolic mortality.},

The reasons for this increased mortality have not been completely defined. We prospectively assessed a cohort of persons with schizophrenia and one with bipolar disorder with a clinical evaluation and a blood sample from which immune and infectious disease markers were measured. Mortality was determined with data from the National Death Index following a period of up to 14 years. We examined the role of demographic, clinical, and serological factors on mortality in bivariate and multivariate models. A total of 43/710 (6.1\%) persons with schizophrenia and 12/406 (3.0\%) with bipolar disorder died of natural causes. In the schizophrenia group, mortality was predicted by the following variables in a multivariate model: cigarette smoking (RR = 6.93, 95\% CI 1.59, 30.1, p = 0.0099); autoimmune disorder (RR = 8.08, 95\% CI 2.50, 26.1, p = 0.00047); gastrointestinal disorder (GI) (RR = 3.53, 95\% CI 1.43, 8.69 p = 0.0061); and reduced maternal education (RR = 0.84, 95\% CI 0.72, 0.97), p = 0.018. The combination of smoking and an autoimmune disorder yielded an unadjusted relative risk of 18.1 for mortality, and the combination of smoking and a GI disorder an unadjusted relative risk of 9.45, compared with individuals with neither risk factor. In the bipolar disorder group, significant bivariate predictors of mortality included lower cognitive score (RR = 0.95, p = .0085) and the presence of type 1 or 2 diabetes (RR = 3.90, p = .026). Given the extraordinary high risk of death due to smoking in schizophrenia, smoking cessation remains an urgent priority.},

This is mainly due to the use of risk-adapted therapies using intensive polychemotherapeutic regimens in combination with other modalities. Patients with early favourable or unfavourable (intermediate) stage disease receive two or four cycles of chemotherapy, respectively, followed by involved-field radiotherapy (20–30 Gy). Advanced stage Hodgkin's lymphoma is treated more aggressively using six to eight cycles of chemotherapy but the effectiveness of consolidative radiotherapy for patients who show a complete response after chemotherapy alone is still unknown. The main challenge in the near future will be the development of strategies that decrease late morbidity and mortality but retain the same efficacy of current regi- mens. In this paper we review current diagnostic techniques and management strategies used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the range of new modalities being used to improve long-term outcome and patient quality of life.},

Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the relationship of PTDM with allograft and patient survival.

  abstract = {Background A unique archive of Big Data on Parkinson’s Disease is collected, managed and disseminated by the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data–large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources–all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for PD classification and prediction. To explore PD risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex PPMI imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data. Methods and Findings Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation. Using heterogeneous PPMI data, we developed a comprehensive protocol for end-to-end data characterization, manipulation, processing, cleaning, analysis and validation. Specifically, we (i) introduce methods for rebalancing imbalanced cohorts, (ii) utilize a wide spectrum of classification methods to generate consistent and powerful phenotypic predictions, and (iii) generate reproducible machine-learning based classification that enables the reporting of model parameters and diagnostic forecasting based on new data. We evaluated several complementary model-based predictive approaches, which failed to generate accurate and reliable diagnostic predictions. However, the results of several machine-learning based classification methods indicated significant power to predict Parkinson’s disease in the PPMI subjects (consistent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity exceeding 96\%, confirmed using statistical n-fold cross-validation). Clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores), demographic (e.g., age), genetics (e.g., rs34637584, chr12), and derived neuroimaging biomarker (e.g., cerebellum shape index) data all contributed to the predictive analytics and diagnostic forecasting. Conclusions Model-free Big Data machine learning-based classification methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, support vector machines) can outperform model-based techniques in terms of predictive precision and reliability (e.g., forecasting patient diagnosis). We observed that statistical rebalancing of cohort sizes yields better discrimination of group differences, specifically for predictive analytics based on heterogeneous and incomplete PPMI data. UPDRS scores play a critical role in predicting diagnosis, which is expected based on the clinical definition of Parkinson’s disease. Even without longitudinal UPDRS data, however, the accuracy of model-free machine learning based classification is over 80\%. The methods, software and protocols developed here are openly shared and can be employed to study other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as for other predictive Big Data analytics applications.},

Methods Data for a representative, cross-sectional sample of 3006 adults (mean age; range 20-74\&emsp14;years) in Jinan from 2007 to 2008 were studied. The association of BMI, WC, and WHtR with cardiovascular risk conditions was assessed by use of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and by calculating the area under the ROC (AUC) and age adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for metabolic syndrome, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Results AUC cut-off values showed that the association of WHtR and WC was higher than that for BMI for all risk conditions for both sexes, except for hypertension in men. The AUC values for WC showed a higher association with hypertension and metabolic syndrome for women than men (p{$<$}0.01 for hypertension, p{$<$}0.05 for metabolic syndrome). The ORs were highest for WHtR for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hypertension in women. The ORs were highest for BMI for hypertension in men.

Within the last years, there have been concerns about the PPI use as they may promote infections in patients with cirrhosis. Aim As there are sparse data of the prognostic relevance of PPI treatment, to perform a prospective study investigating the relation of PPI treatment and overall survival (OS) in cirrhotic individuals. Methods Patients with cirrhosis were enrolled and followed prospectively. The primary end point was OS. PPI treatment and additional clinical and laboratory data were assessed at the day of the study inclusion. The time until the end point death was assessed and the individual risks were calculated with Cox regression analyses. Results A total of 272 patients were included and 213 individuals (78.3\%) were on PPI treatment. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, PPI treatment was associated with higher MELD scores (P = 0.027) and ascites (P = 0.039). In a multivariate Cox regression model, PPI use was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 2.330, 95\% confidence interval 1.264–4.296, P = 0.007) in addition to the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompensation. Conclusions PPI use is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Although a causative role for increased mortality in patients taking PPI is still missing, the prescription of PPI in cirrhotics should be considered carefully taking into account its potential adverse effects.},

It remains unclear to what extent metabolic health status changes over time and whether this affects cardiovascular disease risk. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between metabolic health and its change over time and cardiovascular disease risk across BMI categories. Methods Between June and December, 1976, 121\hphantom{,}701 female nurses were recruited to the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) of whom 103\hphantom{,}298 returned a questionnaire in 1980 used as baseline in this study. After excluding women with a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer, with missing body weight and with underweight. 90\hphantom{,}257 women were followed-up from 1980 to 2010 for incident cardiovascular disease. Participants were cross-classified by BMI categories, metabolic health (defined by absence of diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia), and change in metabolic health status during follow-up. The cardiovascular component of the NHS is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00005152. Findings During 2\hphantom{,}127\hphantom{,}\hphantom{,}391 person-years of follow-up with a median follow-up of 24 years, we documented 6306 cases of cardiovascular disease including 3304 myocardial infarction cases and 3080 strokes. Cardiovascular disease risk of women with metabolically healthy obesity was increased compared with women with metabolically healthy normal weight (HR 1·39, 95\% CI 1·15–1·68), but risk was considerably higher in women with metabolically unhealthy normal weight (2·43, 2·19–2·68), overweight (2·61, 2·36–2·89) and obesity (3·15, 2·83–3·50). The majority of metabolically healthy women converted to unhealthy phenotypes (2555 [84\%] of 3027 women with obesity, 22\hphantom{,}215 [68\%] of 32\hphantom{,}882 women with normal-weight after 20 years). Women who maintained metabolically healthy obesity during follow-up were still at a higher cardiovascular disease risk compared with women with stable healthy normal weight (HR 1·57, 1·03–2·38), yet this risk was lower than for initially metabolically healthy women who converted to an unhealthy phenotype (normal-weight 1·90, 1·66–2·17 vs obesity 2·74, 2·30–3·27). Particularly incident diabetes and hypertension increased the risk among women with initial metabolic health. Interpretation Even when metabolic health is maintained during long periods of time, obesity remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, risks are highest for metabolically unhealthy women across all BMI categories. A large proportion of metabolically healthy women converted to an unhealthy phenotype over time across all BMI categories, which is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention after stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) has focused on high early risk of recurrence, but survivors of stroke can have substantial long-term morbidity and mortality. We quantified long-term morbidity and mortality for patients who had no early complications after stroke or TIA and community-based controls. METHODS: This longitudinal case–control study included all ambulatory or hospitalized patients with stroke or TIA (discharged from regional stroke centres in Ontario from 2003 to 2013) who survived for 90 days without recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, all-cause admission to hospital, admission to an institution or death. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex and geographic location. The primary composite outcome was death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or admission to long-term or continuing care. We calculated 1-, 3- and 5-year rates of composite and individual outcomes and used cause-specific Cox regression to estimate long-term hazards for cases versus controls and for patients with stroke versus those with TIA. RESULTS: Among patients who were initially stable after stroke or TIA (n = 26 366), the hazard of the primary outcome was more than double at 1 year (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–2.5), 3 years (HR 2.2, 95\% CI 2.1–2.3) and 5 years (HR 2.1, 95\% CI 2.1–2.2). Hazard was highest for recurrent stroke at 1 year (HR 6.8, 95\% CI 6.1–7.5), continuing to 5 years (HR 5.1, 95\% CI 4.8–5.5), and for admission to an institution (HR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.9–2.2). Survivors of stroke had higher mortality and morbidity, but 31.5\% (1789/5677) of patients with TIA experienced an adverse event within 5 years. INTERPRETATION: Patients who survive stroke or TIA without early complications are typically discharged from secondary stroke prevention services. However, these patients remain at substantial long-term risk, particularly for recurrent stroke and admission to an institution. Novel approaches to prevention, potentially embedded in community or primary care, are required for long-term management of these initially stable but high-risk patients.},

  abstract = {In early breast cancer, variations in local treatment that substantially affect the risk of locoregional recurrence could also affect long-term breast cancer mortality. To examine this relationship, collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken, based on individual patient data, of the relevant randomised trials that began by 1995. Information was available on 42\hphantom{,}000 women in 78 randomised treatment comparisons (radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy, 23\hphantom{,}500; more vs less surgery, 9300; more surgery vs radiotherapy, 9300). 24 types of local treatment comparison were identified. To help relate the effect on local (ie, locoregional) recurrence to that on breast cancer mortality, these were grouped according to whether or not the 5-year local recurrence risk exceeded 10\% ({$<$}10\%, 17\hphantom{,}000 women; {$>$}10\%, 25\hphantom{,}000 women). About three-quarters of the eventual local recurrence risk occurred during the first 5 years. In the comparisons that involved little ({$<$}10\%) difference in 5-year local recurrence risk there was little difference in 15-year breast cancer mortality. Among the 25\hphantom{,}000 women in the comparisons that involved substantial ({$>$}10\%) differences, however, 5-year local recurrence risks were 7\% active versus 26\% control (absolute reduction 19\%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks were 44·6\% versus 49·5\% (absolute reduction 5·0\%, SE 0·8, 2p{$<$}0·00001). These 25\hphantom{,}000 women included 7300 with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in trials of radiotherapy (generally just to the conserved breast), with 5-year local recurrence risks (mainly in the conserved breast, as most had axillary clearance and node-negative disease) 7\% versus 26\% (reduction 19\%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks 30·5\% versus 35·9\% (reduction 5·4\%, SE 1·7, 2p=0·0002; overall mortality reduction 5·3\%, SE 1·8, 2p=0·005). They also included 8500 with mastectomy, axillary clearance, and node-positive disease in trials of radiotherapy (generally to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes), with similar absolute gains from radiotherapy; 5-year local recurrence risks (mainly at these sites) 6\% versus 23\% (reduction 17\%), and 15-year breast cancer mortality risks 54·7\% versus 60·1\% (reduction 5·4\%, SE 1·3, 2p=0·0002; overall mortality reduction 4·4\%, SE 1·2, 2p=0·0009). Radiotherapy produced similar proportional reductions in local recurrence in all women (irrespective of age or tumour characteristics) and in all major trials of radiotherapy versus not (recent or older; with or without systemic therapy), so large absolute reductions in local recurrence were seen only if the control risk was large. To help assess the life-threatening side-effects of radiotherapy, the trials of radiotherapy versus not were combined with those of radiotherapy versus more surgery. There was, at least with some of the older radiotherapy regimens, a significant excess incidence of contralateral breast cancer (rate ratio 1·18, SE 0·06, 2p=0·002) and a significant excess of non-breast-cancer mortality in irradiated women (rate ratio 1·12, SE 0·04, 2p=0·001). Both were slight during the first 5 years, but continued after year 15. The excess mortality was mainly from heart disease (rate ratio 1·27, SE 0·07, 2p=0·0001) and lung cancer (rate ratio 1·78, SE 0·22, 2p=0·0004). In these trials, avoidance of a local recurrence in the conserved breast after BCS and avoidance of a local recurrence elsewhere (eg, the chest wall or regional nodes) after mastectomy were of comparable relevance to 15-year breast cancer mortality. Differences in local treatment that substantially affect local recurrence rates would, in the hypothetical absence of any other causes of death, avoid about one breast cancer death over the next 15 years for every four local recurrences avoided, and should reduce 15-year overall mortality.},

The patients were divided into 2 groups: those incidentally diagnosed from routine examination findings (precordial murmur and/or abnormal electrocardiographic findings) and those diagnosed either because of symptomatic status or by screening because of a family history of HC. Those patients who had been incidentally diagnosed constituted 29.2\% of our study cohort. Although overall mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (p = 0.12), the patients diagnosed either because of symptoms or a family history tended to have at least a 4.5-fold greater risk of cardiovascular death (relative risk 4.5, 95\% confidence interval 1.04 to 19.6, p = 0.04) and a 4.22 greater risk of sudden death (relative risk 4.22, 95\% confidence interval 1.0 to 18.22, p = 0.04). Despite the greater sudden death mortality among the nonincidentally diagnosed patients, no statistically significant difference was found concerning the sudden death risk factor frequency (p = 0.96) between the 2 groups. In conclusion, the discrepancy between the low numbers of patients reported by published registries and the relatively high prevalence of the disease in the general population can be attributed to the large number of patients who remain asymptomatic, even throughout their life, awaiting an accidental diagnosis. Those patients with an incidental diagnosis have a more benign course, as shown by the total cardiovascular and composite sudden death mortality. A high level of awareness and suspicion for HC among physicians is essential for clinical recognition of such patients.},

  abstract = {Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for melanoma results in accurate nodal staging, which guides treatment decisions. Patients with a negative SLN biopsy in general have a favorable prognosis, but certain subsets are at increased risk for recurrence and death. This study aimed to identify risk factors predictive of prognosis in patients with a tumor-negative SLN biopsy for cutaneous melanoma. In this post-hoc analysis of data from a multicenter prospective randomized trial, clinicopathologic data of patients with cutaneous melanoma ≥1.0~mm Breslow thickness and tumor-negative SLN were analyzed. Disease-free survival, overall survival (OS), and local and in-transit recurrence-free survival were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Risk factors for worse survival were identified with Cox proportional hazard models. This analysis included 1,998 patients with tumor-negative SLN with a median follow-up of 70~months. Ulceration, Breslow thickness, nonextremity tumor location, and age ≥45 years were independent risk factors for worse disease-free survival and OS. Breslow thickness and ulceration were the only factors on multivariate analysis that predicted local and in-transit recurrence-free survival. Estimated 5-year OS rates ranged from 55.5 to 95.4\% on the basis of the defined risk factors. There is a wide range of prognosis among patients with tumor-negative SLN. Breslow thickness, ulceration, age, and anatomic location of the primary melanoma are important independent factors predicting survival and recurrence among such patients. These factors can be used to stratify prognosis among patients with tumor-negative SLN to formulate rational long-term follow-up strategies as well as identify high-risk, SLN-negative patients for clinical trials of adjuvant therapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The impact of modifiable environmental factors on kidney cancer specific outcomes is under studied. We evaluated the impact of smoking exposure on cancer specific survival in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a prospectively maintained database at a single center we collected the characteristics of 1,625 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with surgery between 1995 through 2012. We determined the associations of smoking status with advanced disease, defined as AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage greater than 2, and with cancer specific survival. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of current, former and never smoking at diagnosis was 16\%, 30\% and 54\%, respectively. Of the patients 62\% reported a smoking history of 20 pack-years or greater. Median followup in survivors was 4.5 years (IQR 2.2-7.9). On univariable analysis a smoking history of 20 pack-years or greater was associated with a significantly increased risk of advanced disease (OR 1.43, 95\% CI 1.02-2.00). However, it did not achieve an independent association after adjusting for age and gender. Pathological stage and Fuhrman grade adversely affected cancer specific survival on multivariable competing risks analysis. Although the association between smoking and cancer specific survival did not achieve statistical significance on multivariable analysis, the direction of the central estimate (HR 1.5, 95\% CI 0.89-2.52) suggested that smoking adversely impacts cancer specific survival. Current smokers faced a higher risk of death from another cause than never smokers (HR 1.93, 95\% CI 1.29-2.88). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking exposure substantially increases the risk of death from another cause and adversely impacts cancer specific survival in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Treatment plans to promote smoking cessation are recommended for these patients.},

It became evident then that the best index was the ratio of the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, or the Quetelet Index described in 1832. Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874) was a Belgian mathematician, astronomer and statistician, who developed a passionate interest in probability calculus that he applied to study human physical characteristics and social aptitudes. His pioneering cross-sectional studies of human growth led him to conclude that other than the spurts of growth after birth and during puberty, 'the weight increases as the square of the height', known as the Quetelet Index until it was termed the Body Mass Index in 1972 by Ancel Keys (1904-2004). For his application of comparative statistics to social conditions and moral issues, Quetelet is considered a founder of the social sciences. His principal work, 'A Treatise of Man and the development of his faculties' published in 1835 is considered 'one of the greatest books of the 19th century'. A tireless promoter of statistical data collection based on standard methods and definitions, Quetelet organized in 1853 the first International Statistical Congress, which launched the development of 'a uniform nomenclature of the causes of death applicable to all countries', progenitor of the current International Classification of Diseases.},

We determined the long-term clinical and histological courses of such patients. In a cohort study, 129 consecutively enrolled patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven NAFLD were reevaluated. Survival and causes of death were compared with a matched reference population. Living NAFLD patients were offered repeat liver biopsy and clinical and biochemical investigation. Mean follow-up (SD) was 13.7 (1.3) years. Mortality was not increased in patients with steatosis. Survival of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was reduced (P = .01). These subjects more often died from cardiovascular (P = .04) and liver-related (P = .04) causes. Seven patients (5.4\%) developed end-stage liver disease, including 3 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The absence of periportal fibrosis at baseline had a negative predictive value of 100\% in predicting liver-related complications. At follow-up, 69 of 88 patients had diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Progression of liver fibrosis occurred in 41\%. These subjects more often had a weight gain exceeding 5 kg (P = .02), they were more insulin resistant (P = .04), and they exhibited more pronounced hepatic fatty infiltration (P = .03) at follow-up. In conclusion, NAFLD with elevated liver enzymes is associated with a clinically significant risk of developing end-stage liver disease. Survival is lower in patients with NASH. Most NAFLD patients will develop diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in the long term. Progression of liver fibrosis is associated with more pronounced insulin resistance and significant weight gain. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:865–873.)},

We interrogated datasets generated from two population-based projects (based in the Republic of Ireland and Italy). The Irish patient cohort was divided into Training and Test sub-cohorts. Kaplan–Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify significant predictors of prognoses in the Training set. Using a weighted grading system, a prognostic index was derived that separated three risk groups. The validity of index was tested in the Irish Test sub-cohort and externally confirmed in the Italian replication cohort. In the Training sub-cohort (n~=~117), significant predictors of prognoses were site of disease onset (HR~=~1.7, p~=~0.012); ALSFRS-R slope prior to first evaluation (HR~=~2.8, p~{$<~$}0.0001), and executive dysfunction (HR~=~2.11, p~=~0.001). The risk group system generated using these results predicted median survival time in the Training set, the Test set (n~=~87) and the Italian cohort (n~=~122) with no overlap of the 95~\% CI (p~{$<~$}0.0001). In the validation cohorts, a high-risk classification was associated with a positive predictive value for poor prognosis of 73.3–85.7~\% and a negative predictive value (NPV) for good prognosis of 93.3–100~\%. Classification into the low-risk group was associated with an NPV for bad prognosis of 100~\%. A simple algorithm using variables that can be gathered at first patient encounter, validated in an independent patient series, reliably predicts prognoses in ALS patients.},

Two mortality prediction scores, the bronchiectasis severity index (BSI) and FACED scores, have recently been developed. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of these scores to predict long-term mortality and to compare the two scores. The study was a single-centre retrospective cohort analysis consisting of 91 subjects originally recruited in 1994. BSI and FACED scores were calculated at the time of enrolment and long-term mortality ascertained. Data was available for 74 patients with a median of 18.8 years of follow-up. Both scoring systems had similar predictive power for 5-year mortality (area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) 0.79 for BSI and 0.8 for FACED). Both scores were able to predict 15-year mortality with the FACED score showing slightly superior predictive power (AUC 0.82 versus 0.69, p=0.0495). This study provides further validation of the FACED and BSI scores for the prediction of mortality in bronchiectasis and demonstrates their utility over a longer period than originally described. Whilst both scores had excellent predictive power, the FACED score was superior for 15-year mortality. BSI and FACED bronchiectasis severity scores identify patients at high risk of death over a 19-year follow-up period http://ow.ly/TLiEX},

  abstract = {Importance Online prognostication tools such as PREDICT and Adjuvant! are increasingly used in clinical practice by oncologists to inform patients and guide treatment decisions about adjuvant systemic therapy. However, their validity for young breast cancer patients is debated. Objective To assess first, the prognostic accuracy of PREDICT's and Adjuvant! 10-year all-cause mortality, and second, its breast cancer–specific mortality estimates, in a large cohort of breast cancer patients diagnosed \&lt;50 years. Design Hospital-based cohort. Setting General and cancer hospitals. Participants A consecutive series of 2710 patients without a prior history of cancer, diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 with unilateral stage I–III breast cancer aged \&lt;50 years. Main outcome measures Calibration and discriminatory accuracy, measured with C-statistics, of estimated 10-year all-cause and breast cancer–specific mortality. Results Overall, PREDICT's calibration for all-cause mortality was good (predicted versus observed) meandifference: −1.1\% (95\%CI: −3.2\%–0.9\%; P~=~0.28). PREDICT tended to underestimate all-cause mortality in good prognosis subgroups (range meandifference: −2.9\% to −4.8\%), overestimated all-cause mortality in poor prognosis subgroups (range meandifference: 2.6\%–9.4\%)~and underestimated survival in patients~\&lt;~35 by −6.6\%. Overall, PREDICT overestimated breast cancer–specific mortality by 3.2\% (95\%CI: 0.8\%–5.6\%; P~=~0.007); and also overestimated it seemingly indiscriminately in numerous subgroups (range meandifference: 3.2\%–14.1\%). Calibration was poor in the cohort of patients with the lowest and those with the highest mortality probabilities. Discriminatory accuracy was moderate-to-good for all-cause mortality in PREDICT (0.71 [95\%CI: 0.68 to 0.73]), and the results were similar for breast cancer–specific mortality. Adjuvant!'s calibration and discriminatory accuracy for both all-cause and breast cancer–specific mortality were in line with PREDICT's findings. Conclusions Although imprecise at the extremes, PREDICT's estimates of 10-year all-cause mortality seem reasonably sound for breast cancer patients \&lt;50 years; Adjuvant! findings were similar. Prognostication tools should be used with caution due to the intrinsic variability of their estimates, and because the threshold to discuss adjuvant systemic treatment is low. Thus, seemingly insignificant mortality overestimations or underestimations of a few percentages can significantly impact treatment decision-making.},

Herein, we estimate the population attributable risks (PARs) for various risk factors observed in a multicenter population-based case-control study. METHODS: We calculated PARs by using 293 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 261 with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, 221 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 368 with noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, and 695 control subjects. We included smoking for all four tumor types and Helicobacter pylori infection for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma as established causal risk factors as well as several other factors for which causality is under evaluation. RESULTS: Ever smoking, body mass index above the lowest quartile, history of gastroesophageal reflux, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 39.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 25.6\% to 55.8\%), 41.1\% (95\% CI = 23.8\% to 60.9\%), 29.7\% (95\% CI = 19.5\% to 42.3\%), and 15.3\% (95\% CI = 5.8\% to 34.6\%) of esophageal adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 78.7\% (95\% CI = 66.5\% to 87.3\%). Ever smoking and body mass index above the lowest quartile were responsible for 45.2\% (95\% CI = 31.3\% to 59.9\%) and 19.2\% (95\% CI = 4.9\% to 52.0\%) of gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 56.2\% (95\% CI = 38.1\% to 72.8\%). Ever smoking, alcohol consumption, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 56.9\% (95\% CI = 36.6\% to 75.1\%), 72.4\% (95\% CI = 53.3\% to 85.8\%), and 28.7\% (95\% CI = 11.1\% to 56.5\%) of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 89.4\% (95\% CI = 79.1\% to 95.0\%). Ever smoking, history of gastric ulcers, nitrite intake above the lowest quartile, and H. pylori infection were responsible for 18.3\% (95\% CI = 6.5\% to 41.8\%), 9.7\% (95\% CI = 5.4\% to 16.8\%), 40.7\% (95\% CI = 23.4\% to 60.7\%), and 10.4\% (95\% CI = 0.3\% to 79.6\%) of noncardia gastric adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 59.0\% (95\% CI = 16.2\% to 91.4\%). CONCLUSION: In this population, a few known risk factors account for a majority of esophageal and gastric cancers. These results suggest that the incidence of these cancers may be decreased by reducing the prevalence of smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, and being overweight and by increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables},

  abstract = {Despite revisions in 2005 and 2014, the Gleason prostate cancer (PCa) grading system still has major deficiencies. Combining of Gleason scores into a three-tiered grouping (6, 7, 8–10) is used most frequently for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The lowest score, assigned 6, may be misunderstood as a cancer in the middle of the grading scale, and 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 are often considered the same prognostic group. To verify that a new grading system accurately produces a smaller number of grades with the most significant prognostic differences, using multi-institutional and multimodal therapy data. Between 2005 and 2014, 20 845 consecutive men were treated by radical prostatectomy at five academic institutions; 5501 men were treated with radiotherapy at two academic institutions. Outcome was based on biochemical recurrence (BCR). The log-rank test assessed univariable differences in BCR by Gleason score. Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores. In the surgery cohort, we found large differences in recurrence rates between both Gleason 3+4 versus 4+3 and Gleason 8 versus 9. The hazard ratios relative to Gleason score 6 were 1.9, 5.1, 8.0, and 11.7 for Gleason scores 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9–10, respectively. These differences were attenuated in the radiotherapy cohort as a whole due to increased adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormones for patients with high-grade disease but were clearly seen in patients undergoing radiotherapy only. A five–grade group system had the highest prognostic discrimination for all cohorts on both univariable and multivariable analysis. The major limitation was the unavoidable use of prostate-specific antigen BCR as an end point as opposed to cancer-related death. The new PCa grading system has these benefits: more accurate grade stratification than current systems, simplified grading system of five grades, and lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa. We looked at outcomes for prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and validated a new grading system with more accurate grade stratification than current systems, including a simplified grading system of five grades and a lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poor prognosis, which is explained by the disease itself and by host-related factors. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic role of comorbidities in this population. METHODS. For this single-center, retrospective study, the authors analyzed the outcome of 133 patients aged ≥70 years who received induction chemotherapy for nonpromyelocytic AML between 1995 and 2004. Comorbidities were evaluated by using an adapted form of the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). RESULTS. The median patient age was 73 years. The CCI score was 0 for 83 patients (68\%), 1 for 16 patients (13\%), and {$>$}1 for 23 patients (19\%). The complete remission (CR) rate was 56\%, and the median overall survival was 9 months. In multivariate analysis, 4 adverse prognostic factors for CR were identified: unfavorable karyotype, leukocytosis ≥30 g/L, CD34 expression on leukemic cells, and CCI {$>$}1. A score could be generated to allow the stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with CR rates of 87\%, 63\%, and 37\%, respectively. The risk of early mortality and the probability of survival also were different in the 3 risk groups (P = .02 and P = .01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study indicated that associated comorbidities are independent factors that may influence achievement of CR in elderly patients with AML. Such a scoring system may be useful in the prognostic staging systems that are used to identify patients with AML who can benefit from induction chemotherapy.

  abstract = {Summary Background The benefits of blood pressure lowering treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline blood pressure, presence of comorbidities, or drug class is less clear. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these differences. Method For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE for large-scale blood pressure lowering trials, published between Jan 1, 1966, and July 7, 2015, and we searched the medical literature to identify trials up to Nov 9, 2015. All randomised controlled trials of blood pressure lowering treatment were eligible for inclusion if they included a minimum of 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than hypertension were eligible. We extracted summary-level data about study characteristics and the outcomes of major cardiovascular disease events, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. We used inverse variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool the estimates. Results We identified 123 studies with 613\hphantom{,}815 participants for the tabular meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses showed relative risk reductions proportional to the magnitude of the blood pressure reductions achieved. Every 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular disease events (relative risk [RR] 0·80, 95\% CI 0·77–0·83), coronary heart disease (0·83, 0·78–0·88), stroke (0·73, 0·68–0·77), and heart failure (0·72, 0·67–0·78), which, in the populations studied, led to a significant 13\% reduction in all-cause mortality (0·87, 0·84–0·91). However, the effect on renal failure was not significant (0·95, 0·84–1·07). Similar proportional risk reductions (per 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) were noted in trials with higher mean baseline systolic blood pressure and trials with lower mean baseline systolic blood pressure (all ptrend{$>$}0·05). There was no clear evidence that proportional risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease differed by baseline disease history, except for diabetes and chronic kidney disease, for which smaller, but significant, risk reductions were detected. β blockers were inferior to other drugs for the prevention of major cardiovascular disease events, stroke, and renal failure. Calcium channel blockers were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke. For the prevention of heart failure, calcium channel blockers were inferior and diuretics were superior to other drug classes. Risk of bias was judged to be low for 113 trials and unclear for 10 trials. Heterogeneity for outcomes was low to moderate; the I2 statistic for heterogeneity for major cardiovascular disease events was 41\%, for coronary heart disease 25\%, for stroke 26\%, for heart failure 37\%, for renal failure 28\%, and for all-cause mortality 35\%. Interpretation Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering blood pressure to systolic blood pressures less than 130 mm Hg and providing blood pressure lowering treatment to individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

  abstract = {ObjectiveRadical cystectomy (RC) can provide a survival advantage in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, but not without significant morbidity rates. Whether the ability of preoperative comorbidity or performance status metrics can stratify patients to overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) following RC is unclear. We analyze our RC experience from 2005 to 2010 to assess the prognostic power of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) index as they relate to OS, CSS, and PFS.Materials and methodsA retrospective analysis was performed of 234 patients who underwent RC between January 2005 and December 2010; of these, 148 patients had sufficient data for OS, CSS, and PFS analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling generated hazard ratios using as independent variables patient age at surgery, gender, ethnicity, preoperative KPS, CCI, and ASA values, pathologic T-staging, the presence of nodal disease, use of radiation therapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. A recursive partition analysis tree divided the population into high- and low-performance groups, and 5-year survival outcomes were evaluated. OS, CSS, and PFS were employed as Kaplan–Meier dependent variables with similar populations comprising high- and low-performance subgroups.ResultsMean CSS was 46.8 months (95 \% CI 43.2–50.4) with a 5-year CSS of 75 \% and OS of 69 \%. Patient age, pathologic T-stage, and KPS were identified as independent predictors of OS and CSS. Analysis of PFS as the continuous dependent variable identified only KPS as a statistically significant predictor of freedom from radiologic progression. No statistically significant predictive value was identified for nodal disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, gender, ethnicity, CCI, or ASA in terms of OS, CCS, or PFS. Patients with a KPS ≤ 80 had a shorter survival than patients with a KPS ≥ 90 in terms of OS, CSS, and PFS (log-rank Mantel–Cox: p {$<$} 0.01). For patients with a KPS ≤ 80, \textasciitilde 5-year CSS was 42 \%, while for patients with a KPS ≥ 90 the 5-year survival was 81 \%. These survival curves can be further stratified based on T-stage where patients with a KPS ≥ 90 and {$<$}T2 have a 5-year CSS of 83 \%, patients with a KPS ≥ 90 and {$>$}T2 have a 5-year CSS of 80 \%, whereas patients with a KPS ≤ 80 and {$>$}T2 have a \textasciitilde 5-year CSS of 43 \% (p {$<$} 0.0001).ConclusionsOur study suggests the use of KPS to have predictive capacity in terms of OS, CSS, and PFS. This information can be used to inform patients’ survival expectations prior to proceeding with radical cystectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Counties are the smallest unit for which mortality data are routinely available, allowing consistent and comparable long-term analysis of trends in health disparities. Average life expectancy has steadily increased in the United States but there is limited information on long-term mortality trends in the US counties This study aimed to investigate trends in county mortality and cross-county mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases to county level mortality trends. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used mortality statistics (from the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and population (from the US Census) to estimate sex-specific life expectancy for US counties for every year between 1961 and 1999. Data for analyses in subsequent years were not provided to us by the NCHS. We calculated different metrics of cross-county mortality disparity, and also grouped counties on the basis of whether their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably relative to the national average. We estimated the probability of death from specific diseases for counties with above- or below-average mortality performance. We simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each county's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model. Between 1961 and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US counties was at its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and women, respectively. Cross-county life expectancy SD increased to 2.3 and 1.7 y in 1999. Between 1961 and 1983 no counties had a statistically significant increase in mortality; the major cause of mortality decline for both sexes was reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983 to 1999, life expectancy declined significantly in 11 counties for men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y); another 48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy decline. Life expectancy decline in both sexes was caused by increased mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases, which were no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS and homicide deaths also contributed substantially to life expectancy decline for men, but not for women. Alternative specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in cross-county life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration. CONCLUSIONS: There was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties between 1983 and 1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality among the worst-off segment of the population. Female mortality increased in a large number of counties, primarily because of chronic diseases related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure},

  abstract = {BackgroundPrevious studies showed conflicting and inconsistent results regarding the effect of anatomic location of the melanoma on sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity and/or survival. This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the effect of the anatomic locations of primary melanoma on long-term clinical outcomes.MethodsAll consecutive cutaneous melanoma patients (n = 2,079) who underwent selective SLN dissection (SLND) from 1993 to 2009 in a single academic tertiary-care medical center were included. SLN positive rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined. Kaplan-Meier survival, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictive factors for SLN status, DFS, and OS.ResultsHead and neck melanoma (HNM) had the lowest SLN-positive rate at 10.8 \% (16.8 \% for extremity and 19.3 \% for trunk; P = 0.002) but had the worst 5-year DFS (P {$<$} 0.0001) and 5-year OS (P {$<$} 0.0001) compared with other sites. Tumor thickness (P {$<$} 0.001), ulceration (P {$<$} 0.001), HNM location (P = 0.001), mitotic rate (P {$<$} 0.001), and decreasing age (P {$<$} 0.001) were independent predictive factors for SLN-positivity. HNM with T3 or T4 thickness had significantly lower SLN positive rate compared with other locations (P ≤ 0.05). Also, on multivariate analysis, HNM location versus other anatomic sites was independently predictive of decreased DFS and OS (P {$<$} 0.001). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, HNM was associated significantly with the worst DFS and OS.ConclusionsPrimary melanoma anatomic location is an independent predictor of SLN status and survival. Although HNM has a decreased SLN-positivity rate, it shows a significantly increased risk of recurrence and death as compared with other sites.},

Reduced-intensity/non-myeloablative regimens have decreased the non-relapse mortality (NRM) in elderly and/or heavily pretreated patients. We performed a retrospective study to assess whether HCT-CI may predict clinical outcomes in a cohort of 203 patients with non-Hodgkin's (NHL; n=108), Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL; n=26), and multiple myeloma (MM; n=69), who were transplanted from a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling (n=121) or an unrelated donor (n=82) after a reduced-intensity regimen (n=154) or a low-dose total body irradiation-based non-myeloblative regimen (n=49). Cumulative incidence of NRM was 5, 16 and 20\% at 1 year and 6, 24 and 27\% at 2 years, for patients with an HCT-CI of 0, 1–2 and 3, respectively. By multivariate analysis, HCT-CI significantly predicted NRM (hazard ratio (HR)=1.6, P=0.03), overall survival (OS; HR=1.62, P{$<$}0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS; HR=1.43, P=0.002). Moreover, the Karnofsky performance status was also significantly associated with OS and NRM (HR=1.62, P{$<$}0.001 and HR=2.12, P=0.04, respectively). Conditioning type did not affect outcome after stratifying patients by HCT-CI. In the light of our study, all future prospective trials of the Gruppo Italiano Trapianti di Midollo (GITMO) will include the HCT-CI to stratify patients.},

The authors hypothesized that all-cause mortality is reduced when URH is controlled. Qualified patients followed at the Washington DC VA Medical Center were included. BPs were averaged for each year of follow-up. In 2006, among 2906 patients who met the criteria for drug-resistant hypertension, 628 had URH. During follow-up, 234 patients were controlled (group 1) and 394 patients remained uncontrolled (group 2). The mortality rate among patients with URH was 28\% (110 of 394) and among patients with CRH was 13\% (30 of 234), a 54\% reduction (P{$<$}.01). Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of mortality as uncontrolled HTN (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95\% confidence interval, 1.67–3.75; P{$<$}.01), age (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01–1.04; P{$<$}.01), and diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04–2.05; P{$<$}.027).

However, the rates of, and risk factors for, these outcomes need clarification as a basis for population-based and targeted interventions. We aimed to determine rates and risk factors for these outcomes, and investigate to what extent they are shared across outcomes and are specific to schizophrenia and related disorders. We undertook a total population cohort study in Sweden of 24\hphantom{,}297 patients with schizophrenia and related disorders between January, 1972 and December, 2009. Patients were matched by age and sex to people from the general population (n=485\hphantom{,}940) and also to unaffected sibling controls (n=26\hphantom{,}357). First, we investigated rates of conviction of a violent offence, suicide, and premature mortality, with follow-up until conviction of a violent offence, emigration, death, or end of follow-up (Dec 31, 2009), whichever occurred first. Second, we analysed associations between these adverse outcomes and sociodemographic, individual, familial, and distal risk factors, for men and women separately, with Cox proportional hazards models. Finally, we assessed time trends in adverse outcomes between 1972 and 2009, for which we compared patients with unaffected siblings, and analysed associations with changes in the number of nights spent in inpatient beds in psychiatric facilities nationwide. Within 5 years of their initial diagnosis, 13·9\% of men and 4·7\% of women with schizophrenia and related disorders had a major adverse outcome (10·7\% of men and 2·7\% of women were convicted of a violent offence, and 3·3\% of men and 2·0\% of women died prematurely of any cause). During the study, the adjusted odds ratio of any adverse outcomes for patients compared with general population controls was 7·5 (95\% CI 7·2–7·9) in men and 11·1 (10·2–12·1) in women. Three risk factors that were present before diagnosis were predictive of any adverse outcome: drug use disorders, criminality, and self-harm, which were also risk factors for these outcomes in unaffected siblings and in the general population. Over the period 1973–2009, the odds of these outcomes increased in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders compared with unaffected siblings. Schizophrenia and related disorders are associated with substantially increased rates of violent crime, suicide, and premature mortality. Risk factors for these three outcomes included both those specific to individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders, and those shared with the general population. Therefore, a combination of population-based and targeted strategies might be necessary to reduce the substantial rates of adverse outcomes in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders.

  abstract = {Purpose The aim of the F2 study was to verify whether a prospective collection of data would enable the development of a more accurate prognostic index for follicular lymphoma (FL) by using parameters which could not be retrospectively studied before, and by choosing progression-free survival (PFS) as principal end point.    Patients and Methods Between January 2003 and May 2005, 1,093 patients with a newly diagnosed FL were registered and 942 individuals receiving antilymphoma therapy were selected as the study population. The variables we used for score definition were selected by means of bootstrap resampling procedures on 832 patients with complete data. Procedures to select the model that would minimize errors were also performed.    Results After a median follow-up of 38 months, 261 events for PFS evaluation were recorded. β2-microglobulin higher than the upper limit of normal, longest diameter of the largest involved node longer than 6 cm, bone marrow involvement, hemoglobin level lower than 12 g/dL, and age older than 60 years were factors independently predictive for PFS. Using these variables, a prognostic model was devised to identify three groups at different levels of risk. The 3-year PFS rate was 91\%, 69\%, and 51\% for patients at low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively (log-rank = 64.6; P {$<$} .00001). The 3-year survival rate was 99\%, 96\%, and 84\% for patients at low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively (P {$<$} .0001).    Conclusion Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 is a simple prognostic index based on easily available clinical data and may represent a promising new tool for the identification of patients with FL at different risk in the era of immunochemotherapy.},

Incidence (first stroke in an individual's lifetime) and prevalence were computed by age, sex, and stroke type. Age-standardised incidence and prevalence with the corresponding 95\% CI were plotted for each study to facilitate comparisons. The review shows that the burden of stroke is high and is likely to increase in future decades as a result of demographic and epidemiological transitions in populations. The main features of stroke epidemiology include modest geographical variation in incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality among the—predominantly white—populations studied so far, and a stabilisation or reversal in the declining secular trends in the pre-1990s rates, especially in older people. However, further research that uses the best possible methods to study the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of stroke are urgently needed in other populations of the world, especially in less developed countries where the risk of stroke is high, lifestyles are changing rapidly, and population restructuring is occurring.},

We investigated mortality features in Iranian PD patients focusing on the role of cardiovascular multimorbidity on their survival. Data on mortality and comorbidity profile was gathered in a cohort of 190 individuals with idiopathic PD referred to a Movement Disorders Clinic. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) compared to the Tehran general population was 3.44 and the life expectancy at birth was 67.4 (95\% CI: 59.1–75.8)\,yr. Patients with at least one cardiovascular comorbidity had a shorter survival time after PD onset (14.0 versus 29.2\,yr, p = 0.012). The hazard ratio for death increased 2.8 times (95\% CI: 1.5–5.2, p = 0.002) with one additional cardiovascular comorbidity. Among all comorbid conditions, stroke showed the strongest independent effect on mortality in PD patients [HR = 13.1 (95\% CI: 2.4–71.7), p = 0.003]. Conclusively, life expectancy was slightly lower in Iranian PD patients compared to the general population, while the SMR was high. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity substantially decreased survival in people with PD.

Background Peripheral arterial disease is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment guidelines recommend aggressive management of risk factors and lifestyle modifications. However, the potential benefit of cardiac medication in patients with PAD remains ill defined. Methods In this prospective observational cohort study, 2,420 consecutive patients (age, 64 ± 11 years, 72\% men) with PAD (ankle-brachial index ≤0.90) were screened for clinical risk factors and cardiac medication. Follow-up end point was death from any cause. Propensity scores for statins, beta-blockers, aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, nitrates, coumarins, and digoxin were calculated. Cox regression models were used to analyze the relation between cardiac medication and long-term mortality. Results Medical history included diabetes mellitus in 436 patients (18\%), hypercholesterolemia in 581 (24\%), smoking in 837 (35\%), hypertension in 1,162 (48\%), coronary artery disease in 1,065 (44\%), and a history of heart failure in 214 (9\%). Mean ankle-brachial index was 0.58 (±0.18). During a median follow-up of eight years, 1,067 patients (44\%) died. After adjustment for risk factors and propensity scores, statins (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 0.58), beta-blockers (HR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.58 to 0.80), aspirins (HR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.61 to 0.84), and ACE inhibitors (HR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.69 to 0.94) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of long-term mortality. Conclusions On the basis of this observational longitudinal study, statins, beta-blockers, aspirins, and ACE inhibitors are associated with a reduction in long-term mortality in patients with PAD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to evaluate survival among current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers who are diagnosed with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The study included patients who participated in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's NSCLC Database Project. Current, former, and never smokers were compared with respect to overall survival by fitting Cox regression models. RESULTS: Data from 4200 patients were examined, including 618 never smokers, 1483 current smokers, 380 former smokers who quit 1 to 12 months before diagnosis, and 1719 former smokers who quit {$>$}12 months before diagnosis. Among patients with stage I, II, and III disease, only never smokers had better survival than current smokers (hazard ratio, 0.47 [95\% confidence interval, 0.26-0.85] vs 0.51 [95\% confidence interval, 0.38-0.68], respectively). Among patients with stage IV disease, the impact of smoking depended on age: Among younger patients (aged ≤55 years), being a never smoker and a former smoker for ≥12 months increased survival. After age 85 years, smoking status did not have a significant impact on overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were smoking at the time of diagnosis had worse survival compared with never smokers. Among younger patients with stage IV disease, current smokers also had worse survival compared with former smokers who quit {$>$}12 months before diagnosis. It is likely that tumor biology plays a major role in the differences observed; however, to improve survival, it is prudent to encourage all smokers to quit smoking if they are diagnosed with NSCLC.

Clinical and epidemiologic factors predicting mortality are poorly understood. Methods. Clinical and epidemiologic features including patient history and physical, functional, and cognitive scores were collected from a hospital-based cohort of PD patients using standardized protocols and clinical scales. Data on comorbidities and mortality were collected on follow-up. Results. During a mean follow-up of 4.71 years (range 1–10), 43 (20.9\%) of the 206 patients died. Those who died had higher mean age at disease onset than those still alive at the last follow-up (67.7 years versus 56.3 years; p {$<$} 0.01). In the univariate analysis, age at baseline was associated with decreased survival. In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, age at disease onset and race/ethnicity were predictors of mortality. Conclusions. Late age at disease onset and advanced chronological age are associated with decreased survival. Comorbidities and PD characteristics were not associated with decreased survival in our sample. Race/ethnicity was found in our study to be associated with increased hazard of mortality. Our findings indicate the importance of studying survival among different populations of PD patients.},

  abstract = {Summary The outlook for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia has improved in the past 30 years. Unlike other cancers, much of this progress is attributable to refinement of supportive treatment, rather than the introduction of new drugs. New antibacterial and antifungal agents, antiemetics, and improved transfusion support have decreased the rate of early death, and morbidity and mortality from allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been substantially reduced. However, more than half of young adult patients and about 90\% of older patients still die from their disease. Refractoriness to initial induction treatment and, more frequently, relapse after complete remission, are still the main obstacles to cure. Accordingly, new treatment approaches with mechanisms of action different from those of conventional chemotherapy are needed. Our knowledge of the various chromosomal and molecular abnormalities implicated in the pathogenesis of the many subtypes of the disease has greatly expanded; as a result, clinical research is moving towards the investigation of new non-cytotoxic agents in combination with chemotherapy. The goal is to target the molecular abnormalities identified at diagnosis; however, several aberrations can coexist in subclones of acute myeloid leukaemia, making the disease less likely to be inhibited by a single agent.},

DESIGN: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC). SETTING: 23 centres in 10 countries. PARTICIPANTS: 380\hspace{0.25em}395 men and women, free of cancer, diabetes, heart attack or stroke at enrolment, followed up for 12.6\hspace{0.25em}years on average. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 20\hspace{0.25em}453 fatal events, of which 2053 alcohol-related cancers (ARC, including cancers of upper aerodigestive tract, liver, colorectal and female breast), 4187 cardiovascular diseases/coronary heart disease (CVD/CHD), 856 violent deaths and injuries. Lifetime alcohol use was assessed at recruitment. RESULTS: HRs comparing extreme drinkers (≥30\hspace{0.25em}g/day in women and ≥60\hspace{0.25em}g/day in men) to moderate drinkers (0.1-4.9\hspace{0.25em}g/day) were 1.27 (95\% CI 1.13 to 1.43) in women and 1.53 (1.39 to 1.68) in men. Strong associations were observed for ARC mortality, in men particularly, and for violent deaths and injuries, in men only. No associations were observed for CVD/CHD mortality among drinkers, whereby HRs were higher in never compared to moderate drinkers. Overall mortality seemed to be more strongly related to beer than wine use, particularly in men. The 10-year risks of overall death for women aged 60\hspace{0.25em}years, drinking more than 30\hspace{0.25em}g/day was 5\% and 7\%, for never and current smokers, respectively. Corresponding figures~in men consuming more than 60\hspace{0.25em}g/day were 11\% and 18\%, in never and current smokers, respectively. In competing risks analyses, mortality due to CVD/CHD was more pronounced than ARC in men, while CVD/CHD and ARC mortality were of similar magnitude in women. CONCLUSIONS: In this large European cohort, alcohol use was positively associated with overall mortality, ARC and violent death and injuries, but marginally to CVD/CHD. Absolute risks of death observed in EPIC suggest that alcohol is an important determinant of total mortality.},

Knowledge on the prognosis among patients with cirrhosis is mainly based on clinical trials with selected patient groups as well as population-based register studies with suboptimal diagnostic reliability. The aim of the study was to describe incidence, etiology, and mortality of well-validated cirrhotic cases in a population-based cohort at Funen (population 470,000) between 1996 and 2006. Materials and methods. A population-based cohort study with case identification from discharge diagnosis followed by manual validation of patient records with inclusion of cases that fulfilled predefined diagnostic criteria. Results. 4010 possible cases were identified. 1369 patients were included, 67\% males, mean age 56.4 years, 75\% had cirrhotic complications at entry. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years with a total of 4976 years of follow-up. The incidence was 33/100,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval CI 28–40). Stratified for age and sex, the incidence was twice as high for men compared with women in all age groups. The five-year mortality was 62\% (95\% CI 59–65). A multivariate analysis showed a high mortality associated with male gender (HR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.08–1.42), ages above 70 years (HR 2.01 95\% CI 1.65–2.47) compared with ages 50–59 years, complications present at diagnosis (HR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.09–1.50) and etiology of alcoholic disease or cryptogenic cirrhosis (HR 2.38, 95\% CI 1.22–4.67 and 2.26, 95\% CI 1.13–4.53). Conclusions. Incidence of cirrhosis is higher among men than among women. High age, male gender, alcoholic cirrhosis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and complications at the time of diagnosis increased mortality.},

In our kidney cancer database we identified 388 patients who were treated with radical or partial nephrectomy for conventional RCC between 1986 and 2000. Associations of the pathological features studied with death from RCC were evaluated using the log rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression model. The predictive ability of competing models was evaluated using the c index. Median followup in the 290 patients who were alive at last followup was 5 years (range 5 months to 17 years). The estimated cancer specific survival rate 5 years following surgery was 81.3\%. All features that comprise the SSIGN score except tumor size were significantly associated with death from RCC in a multivariate setting, resulting in a c index of 0.90. The median SSIGN score in the 388 patients studied was 3 (range 0 to 15). The c index in a model containing the clear cell SSIGN score was 0.88. Five-year cancer specific survival rates in patients with a score of 0 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, 7 to 9 and 10 or more were 100.0\%, 90.5\%, 63.6\%, 46.8\% and 0\%, respectively.

The aims of this study were to report the natural history of hepatitis C cirrhosis after liver transplantation and to identify risk factors for decompensation and survival. Hepatitis C patients underwent protocol liver biopsies yearly after liver transplantation. After cirrhosis was identified by biopsy, the outcomes of interest were the development of decompensation, death, or retransplantation for hepatitis C. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis was used to determine survival and risk factors for decompensation and mortality. Out of 502 liver transplants performed for hepatitis C, 88 patients (18\%) had cirrhosis within 3.7 years. Seventy-one patients were compensated at diagnosis. The cumulative probability of decompensation 1 year after cirrhosis was 30\%. A Model for End-Stage Liver disease score ≥ 16 was predictive of decompensation and poor survival, whereas successful interferon treatment was found to reduce this risk (relative risk = 0.05). Once decompensation occurred, 1-year survival was 46\%. In conclusion, the results confirm an accelerated natural history of hepatitis C cirrhosis after liver transplantation and demonstrate poor survival after decompensation. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease can stratify risk for decompensation and survival, whereas successful antiviral therapy may be protective. Liver Transpl 15:1063–1071, 2009. © 2009 AASLD.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with development and validation cohorts. SETTING: All 643 Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes in New York State during the study period. PARTICIPANTS: The study included data on residents collected during full MDS assessments from June 1994 through December 1997. A total of 100,669 nursing home residents met the inclusion criteria for the newly admitted resident analysis. The newly admitted development cohort included 60,341 residents, and the newly admitted validation cohort included 40,328 residents. A total of 36,125 nursing home residents met inclusion criteria for the long-stay (residing in nursing home{$>$}1 year) cohort. The long-stay development cohort included 22,749 residents, and the long-stay validation cohort included 15,068 residents. MEASUREMENTS: The analytical approach was similar for the newly admitted and long-stay resident cohorts. Resident characteristics that were considered potential risk factors for mortality were examined individually in bivariate proportional hazards models, and factors with P {$<$}.05 were entered into a proportional hazards regression stepwise model. The strongest factors based on their chi-square values were selected for entry into a multivariate proportional hazards analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs), 95\% confidence intervals, and P-values were derived from this model. A mortality risk index score was created for each resident by summing the value of each HR in the multivariate model for those who had the risk factor. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of residents with an unknown death status. A similar analysis was performed on the validation cohort to validate the original results. RESULTS: Major factors associated with 1-year mortality were identified in both the newly admitted and long-stay cohorts. In both newly admitted and long-stay residents, a higher mortality risk index score was associated with increased 1-year mortality in both the development and validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: MDS data can identify major factors associated with 1-year mortality in newly admitted and long-stay nursing home residents. These factors can be used to stratify residents into risk categories for 1-year mortality. This information could be important to residents, their families, and their physicians when developing care plans, as well as to agencies interested in healthcare resource planning.},

In this study, the authors investigated the possible magnitude and direction of bias in estimating deaths attributable to obesity when such a method is used. Hypothetical examples are based on 1991 US population data and published relative risks. Incomplete adjustment for confounding of the obesity-mortality relation by age and sex led to a 17\% overestimation of deaths due to obesity. Additional bias resulted from slight differences between the derivation cohort and the target population. For example, a difference of three percentage points in the proportion of people 80 years of age or older led to a 42\% overestimation of deaths due to obesity. In addition, these estimates appear to be sensitive to minor differences in relative risks between a derivation cohort and the target population. A difference of 0.20 in relative risks almost doubled the number of deaths (97\% overestimation). Estimates of deaths attributable to obesity can be biased if confounding and effect modification are not properly taken into account or if the relative risks are not estimated accurately},

We conclude that patients with lung cancers detected in stage I by chest x-ray film and treated surgically have a good chance of remaining free of disease for many years. Those stage I lung cancers which are not resected progress and lead to death within five years.

Aim: To determine the overall survival in patients with cirrhosis compared with the general population taking into account the effects of severity and aetiology of disease and comorbidity. Methods: In a cohort study, we identified 4537 people with cirrhosis and a control cohort of 44 403 patients, matched by age, sex and general practice from the UK General Practice Research Database between June 1987 and April 2002. Results: Patients with compensated cirrhosis had a nearly five-fold [hazard ratio (HR) 4.7, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 4.4–5.0] increased risk of death, while those with decompensated cirrhosis had a near 10-fold (HR 9.7, 95\% CI 8.9–10.6) increased risk compared with the general population. Alcoholic cirrhosis conferred a worse prognosis than non-alcohol-related cirrhosis both in the first year following diagnosis and subsequently. Conclusion: Having a diagnosis of cirrhosis confers a substantial increased mortality risk compared with the general population, even for those with compensated disease, with 5-year survival between that seen for breast and colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {Although mortality risk scores for chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients should have an important role in clinical decision-making, those currently available have limited applicability, robustness, and generalizability. Here we applied a modified Framingham Heart Study approach to derive 1- and 2-year all-cause mortality risk scores using a 11,508 European incident HD patient database (AROii) recruited between 2007 and 2009. This scoring model was validated externally using similar-sized Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Survey (DOPPS) data. For AROii, the observed 1- and 2-year mortality rates were 13.0 (95\% confidence interval (CI; 12.3–13.8)) and 11.2 (10.4–12.1)/100 patient years, respectively. Increasing age, low body mass index, history of cardiovascular disease or cancer, and use of a vascular access catheter during baseline were consistent predictors of mortality. Among baseline laboratory markers, hemoglobin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and creatinine predicted death within 1 and 2 years. When applied to the DOPPS population, the predictive risk score models were highly discriminatory, and generalizability remained high when restricted by incidence/prevalence and geographic location (C-statistics 0.68–0.79). This new model offers improved predictive power over age/comorbidity-based models and also predicted early mortality (C-statistic 0.71). Our new model delivers a robust and reproducible mortality risk score, based on readily available clinical and laboratory data.},

  abstract = {Background: The host inflammatory response has a vital role in carcinogenesis and tumour progression. We examined the prognostic value of inflammatory markers (albumin, white-cell count and its components, and platelets) in pre-treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Methods: Using data from a randomised trial, multivariable proportional hazards models were generated to examine the impact of inflammatory markers and established prognostic factors (performance status, calcium, and haemoglobin) on overall survival (OS). We evaluated a new prognostic classification incorporating additional information from inflammatory markers. Results: Of the 416 patients, 362 were included in the analysis. Elevated neutrophil counts, elevated platelet counts, and a high neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio were significant independent predictors for shorter OS in a model with established prognostic factors. The addition of inflammatory markers improves the discriminatory value of the prognostic classification as compared with established factors alone (C-statistic 0.673 vs 0.654, P=0.002 for the difference), with 25.8\% (P=0.004) of patients more appropriately classified using the new classification. Conclusion: Markers of systemic inflammation contribute significantly to prognostic classification in addition to established factors for pre-treated patients with advanced RCC. Upon validation of these data in independent studies, stratification of patients using these markers in future clinical trials is recommended.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An assessment of energy needs is a necessary component in the development and evaluation of a nutrition care plan. The metabolic rate can be measured or estimated by equations, but estimation is by far the more common method. However, predictive equations might generate errors large enough to impact outcome. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken to document the accuracy of predictive equations preliminary to deciding on the imperative to measure metabolic rate. METHODS: As part of a larger project to determine the role of indirect calorimetry in clinical practice, an evidence team identified published articles that examined the validity of various predictive equations for resting metabolic rate (RMR) in nonobese and obese people and also in individuals of various ethnic and age groups. Articles were accepted based on defined criteria and abstracted using evidence analysis tools developed by the American Dietetic Association. Because these equations are applied by dietetics practitioners to individuals, a key inclusion criterion was research reports of individual data. The evidence was systematically evaluated, and a conclusion statement and grade were developed. RESULTS: Four prediction equations were identified as the most commonly used in clinical practice (Harris-Benedict, Mifflin-St Jeor, Owen, and World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization/United Nations University [WHO/FAO/UNU]). Of these equations, the Mifflin-St Jeor equation was the most reliable, predicting RMR within 10\% of measured in more nonobese and obese individuals than any other equation, and it also had the narrowest error range. No validation work concentrating on individual errors was found for the WHO/FAO/UNU equation. Older adults and US-residing ethnic minorities were underrepresented both in the development of predictive equations and in validation studies. CONCLUSIONS: The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is more likely than the other equations tested to estimate RMR to within 10\% of that measured, but noteworthy errors and limitations exist when it is applied to individuals and possibly when it is generalized to certain age and ethnic groups. RMR estimation errors would be eliminated by valid measurement of RMR with indirect calorimetry, using an evidence-based protocol to minimize measurement error. The Expert Panel advises clinical judgment regarding when to accept estimated RMR using predictive equations in any given individual. Indirect calorimetry may be an important tool when, in the judgment of the clinician, the predictive methods fail an individual in a clinically relevant way. For members of groups that are greatly underrepresented by existing validation studies of predictive equations, a high level of suspicion regarding the accuracy of the equations is warranted.},

RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) and presence of a cardiac disease reached statistical significance for prediction of overall survival in a Cox regression model. In addition to BMI ({$<$}25 kg/m(2)) and the presence of cardiovascular disease, the spirometric variable (FEV1) predicted early death (less than five months postoperatively). When the survival random forest method was employed to predict disease outcome, creatinine levels and VO2 max became additional variables of interest for predicting survival. CONCLUSION: We propose that our lung cancer database may help to identify variables (aside from histomorphological variables) that are suitable for identifying patients at risk of death after surgical treatment of lung cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Denmark is facing a shortage of nurses and this trend is anticipated to worsen within the next decades. The major reason for this shortage is that only very few nurses remain employed until the general retirement age. Every year several nurses are expelled from the labour market prematurely which causes a problem not only for the disabled nurses but also because it can affect the morale and productivity among the remaining personnel while new staff members are hired and trained. AIM The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between lifestyle, working environment, socio-demographic factors and disability pension (DP) among nurses. METHODS The study was based on 12,028 nurses above the age of 44 who in 1993 completed a questionnaire. The survey information was combined with longitudinal data from a register compiled by Statistics Denmark. The follow-up period was from 1993 to 2002. RESULTS Nurses with relatively low gross incomes were more likely to become disability pensioners compared to nurses with high incomes (hazard ratio, HR 1.33 and HR 2.17). Also, nurses who were singles had a higher probability of entering DP (HR 1.63). Nurses who worked fixed evening or night shifts had higher risks of DP than nurses who worked daytime exclusively (HR 1.51 and HR 1.45). Smoking, obesity and having a sedentary lifestyle were also risk indicators for DP (HR 1.42, HR 1.63 and HR 1.50). Furthermore, low influence and high physical demands at work increased the probability of entering DP (HR 1.39 and HR 1.22). CONCLUSION DP among nurses is influenced by a number of factors. Nurses who have poor working environments and/or unhealthy lifestyles have higher risks of becoming disability pensioners. Also, nurses who are singles and/or have low gross incomes have higher probability of entering DP.},

  abstract = {Summary Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-mediated signalling and angiogenesis can contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of gastric cancer. We aimed to assess whether ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, prolonged survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer. We did an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial between Oct 6, 2009, and Jan 26, 2012, at 119 centres in 29 countries in North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa. Patients aged 24–87 years with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and disease progression after first-line platinum-containing or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy were randomly assigned (2:1), via a central interactive voice-response system, to receive best supportive care plus either ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo, intravenously once every 2 weeks. The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00917384. 355 patients were assigned to receive ramucirumab (n=238) or placebo (n=117). Median overall survival was 5·2 months (IQR 2·3–9·9) in patients in the ramucirumab group and 3·8 months (1·7–7·1) in those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·776, 95\% CI 0·603–0·998; p=0·047). The survival benefit with ramucirumab remained unchanged after multivariable adjustment for other prognostic factors (multivariable HR 0·774, 0·605–0·991; p=0·042). Rates of hypertension were higher in the ramucirumab group than in the placebo group (38 [16\%] vs nine [8\%]), whereas rates of other adverse events were mostly similar between groups (223 [94\%] vs 101 [88\%]). Five (2\%) deaths in the ramucirumab group and two (2\%) in the placebo group were considered to be related to study drug. Ramucirumab is the first biological treatment given as a single drug that has survival benefits in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma progressing after first-line chemotherapy. Our findings validate VEGFR-2 signalling as an important therapeutic target in advanced gastric cancer. ImClone Systems.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a cohort of 120,679 Pennsylvania Medicare enrollees with drug coverage through a pharmacy assistance program, we developed a single numerical comorbidity score for predicting 1-year mortality, by combining the conditions in the Charlson and Elixhauser measures. We externally validated the combined score in a cohort of New Jersey Medicare enrollees, by comparing its performance to that of both component scores in predicting 1-year mortality, as well as 180-, 90-, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: C-statistics from logistic regression models including the combined score were higher than corresponding c-statistics from models including either the Romano implementation of the Charlson Index or the single numerical version of the Elixhauser system; c-statistics were 0.860 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.854, 0.866), 0.839 (95\% CI: 0.836, 0.849), and 0.836 (95\% CI: 0.834, 0.847), respectively, for the 30-day mortality outcome. The combined comorbidity score also yielded positive values for two recently proposed measures of reclassification.

This study shows that serum CRP is an independent predictor for cancer-specific survival in bladder cancer, and its incorporation into a new outcome model (TNR-C Score) encompassing major pathological determinants for survival, increases significantly its predictive accuracy.  OBJECTIVE •\hspace{0.6em}To assess the predictive value of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for carcinoma invading the bladder in light of recent data showing it to be an independent indicator of adverse oncological outcome in other malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS •\hspace{0.6em}A contemporary, consecutive series of 246 patients undergoing RC and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy for bladder cancer between 1999 and 2009.•\hspace{0.6em}Elevated CRP was defined as {$>$}0.5~mg/dL and was consistent during the study period. The median (range) follow-up was 30 (6–116)~months.•\hspace{0.6em}Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to estimate cancer-specific survival (CSS) using a log-rank test and Cox regression analysis for multivariate analysis of risk factors.•\hspace{0.6em}Based on regression estimates of significant parameters in multivariate analysis, a new CRP-based scoring model was developed to predict cancer-specific outcomes. The predictive accuracy of the model was evaluated using the concordance index. RESULTS •\hspace{0.6em}The 3-year CSS was 74.0\% in patients with normal and 44.0\% with elevated CRP (P {$<$} 0.001).•\hspace{0.6em}In multivariate analysis, CRP (P {$<$} 0.001; used as a continuous variable), tumour stage (P= 0.001), lymph-node density ≥0.09 (P= 0.02) and resection margin status (P {$<$} 0.001) were independent predictors of CSS.•\hspace{0.6em}The 3-year CSS in patients with a score in the ranges 0–2, 3–6 and 7–10 was 80.5\%, 44.9\% and 7.1\%, respectively (P {$<$} 0.001). Consideration of CRP in the final model increased its predictive accuracy by 4.9\% with a concordance index of 0.788 (P= 0.01). CONCLUSIONS •\hspace{0.6em}This is the largest, contemporary series to date indicating that preoperative serum CRP is an independent risk factor for CSS.•\hspace{0.6em}CRP may be a useful parameter to include in predictive bladder cancer nomograms.},

Empirically identified limits, population percentiles, and z scores have all been suggested as means of setting percentage body fat guidelines, although each has major limitations. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine a potential new approach for developing percentage body fat ranges. The approach taken was to link healthy body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization with predicted percentage body fat. DESIGN Body fat was measured in subjects from 3 ethnic groups (white, African American, and Asian) who were screened and evaluated at 3 universities [Cambridge (United Kingdom), Columbia (United States), and Jikei (Japan)] with use of reference body-composition methods [4-compartment model (4C) at 2 laboratories and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at all 3 laboratories]. Percentage body fat prediction equations were developed based on BMI and other independent variables. RESULTS A convenient sample of 1626 adults with BMIs {$<$} or =35 was evaluated. Independent percentage body fat predictor variables in multiple regression models included 1/BMI, sex, age, and ethnic group (R: values from 0.74 to 0.92 and SEEs from 2.8 to 5.4\% fat). The prediction formulas were then used to prepare provisional healthy percentage body fat ranges based on published BMI limits for underweight ({$<$}18.5), overweight ({$>$} or =25), and obesity ({$>$} or =30). CONCLUSION This proposed approach and initial findings provide the groundwork and stimulus for establishing international healthy body fat ranges.},

Methods: The EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study included 518,108 individuals recruited from the general population across 10 Western European countries. At recruitment, information on lifestyle was collected and anthropometric characteristics were measured. Cox hazard models were fitted to investigate the associations between anthropometric measures and ALS mortality. Results: Two hundred twenty-two ALS deaths (79 men and 143 women) occurred during the follow-up period (mean follow-up = 13 years). There was a statistically significant interaction between categories of body mass index and sex regarding ALS risk (p = 0.009): in men, a significant linear decrease of risk per unit of body mass index was observed (hazard ratio = 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.86–0.99 per kg/m2); among women, the risk was more than 3-fold increased for underweight compared with normal-weight women. Among women, a significant risk reduction increasing the waist/hip ratio was also evident: women in the top quartile had less than half the risk of ALS compared with those in the bottom quartile (hazard ratio = 0.48, 95\% confidence interval 0.25–0.93) with a borderline significant p value for trend across quartiles (p = 0.056). Conclusion: Increased prediagnostic body fat is associated with a decreased risk of ALS mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The current study was conducted to develop a pretreatment prognostic model for patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial cancer who were treated with first-line, cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS Individual data were pooled from 399 patients who were enrolled on 8 phase 2 and 3 trials evaluating cisplatin-based, first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Variables selected for inclusion in the model were combined in a Cox proportional hazards model to produce a points-based nomogram with which to predict the median, 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year survival. The nomogram was validated externally using data from a randomized trial of the combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin plus cisplatin versus docetaxel plus cisplatin. RESULTS The median survival of the development cohort was 13.8 months (95\% confidence interval, 12.1 months-16.0 months); 68.2\% of the patients had died at the time of last follow-up. On multivariable analysis, the number of visceral metastatic sites, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and leukocyte count were each found to be associated with overall survival (P\,{$<$}\,.05), whereas the site of the primary tumor and the presence of lymph node metastases were not. All 5 variables were included in the nomogram. When subjected to internal validation, the nomogram achieved a bootstrap-corrected concordance index of 0.626. When applied to the external validation cohort, the nomogram achieved a concordance index of 0.634. Calibration plots suggested that the nomogram was well calibrated for all predictions. CONCLUSIONS Based on routinely measured pretreatment variables, a nomogram was constructed that predicts survival in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic urothelial cancer who are treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To identify factors associated with mortality in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and to evaluate whether these factors vary according to severity of cognitive impairment. METHODS Data were from the SAGE database which includes information on all residents admitted between 1992 and 1995 to all Medicare/ Medicaid certified nursing homes of five US states. We conducted a longitudinal follow up study (median 23 months) on 9264 patients aged 65 years and above with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Patient data including demographic characteristics, dementia severity, comorbidity, and other clinical and treatment variables were collected with the Minimum Data Set. Information on death was derived through linkage to Medicare files. Baseline characteristics were used to predict survival in univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS Overall mortality rate was 50\%, with a first year rate of 25.7\%. Increased age (risk ratio (RR) 1.83; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.65–2.03, for patients 85+ years), male sex (RR 1.81; 95\% CI 1.70–1.94), limitation in physical function (RR 1.45; 95\% CI 1.27–1.66), a condition of malnutrition (RR 1.31; 95\%CI 1.23–1.39), the presence of pressure ulcers (RR 1.24; 95\% CI 1.13–1.36), a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (RR 1.32; 95\% CI 1.21–1.43), and of cardiovascular diseases (RR 1.22; 95\% CI 1.14–1.30) were independent predictors of death, regardless of the severity of baseline dementia. Sensory problems (hearing and vision) and urinary incontinence were associated with increased mortality only among patients with less severe dementia. The presence of disruptive behaviour, aphasia, and a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease were not related to survival. African-Americans and other minority groups were less likely to die relative to white people. CONCLUSIONS Age, sex, functional limitation, and malnutrition seem to be the strongest predictors of death for patients with Alzheimer’s disease in nursing homes. Altogether, severity of dementia has no influence on survival, yet the predictive role of certain variables depends on the degree of impairment. Minority groups have a reduced risk of death relative to white people.},

Of 58 full texts reviewed, 26 met our inclusion criteria that were derived from 21 and seven studies examining the impacts of COPD and emphysema on survival of lung cancer, respectively. Meta-analyses revealed that concomitant COPD was associated with poorer OS (HR, 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.10–1.25, n\,=\,20), which was independent of tumour staging, diagnostic criteria of COPD or location, and DFS (HR, 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.04–2.23, n\,=\,6) with high heterogeneity (I2\,=\,78\%). The presence of emphysema in patients with lung cancer predicted worse OS (HR, 1.66; 95\% CI: 1.25–2.22, n\,=\,7), but not poorer DFS. The presence of COPD and emphysema are robust predictors of poor survival in patients with lung cancer.

Fasting plasma insulin (FPI) levels were measured, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. According to OGTT results two groups of patients were formed: those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and those with SAGT. Patients were followed every three months. The mean follow-up was 932 d (range of 180-1925). Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meyer method, and predictive factors of death were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model., RESULTS: Of the included patients, 30 showed NGT and 70 SAGT. Groups were significantly different only in age, INR, FPI and HOMA2-IR. Patients with SAGT showed lower 5-year cumulated survival than NGT patients (31.7\% vs 71.6\%, P = 0.02). Differences in survival were significant only after 3 years of follow-up. SAGT, Child-Pugh B, and high Child-Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were independent predictors of death. The causes of death in 90.3\% of cases were due to complications related to liver disease., CONCLUSION: SAGT was associated with lower survival.

The relative risk (RR) of each outcome in the COPD cohort was compared with that in a control cohort with no diagnosis of COPD.

  abstract = {Background: COPD and radiographic bronchiectasis frequently coexist but the effect of this on the clinical course of COPD is not fully understood. We determined the impact of bronchiectasis on clinical outcomes in COPD patients, independent of coexisting emphysema and bronchial wall thickening (BWT). Methods: COPD patients admitted with first exacerbation 1998–2008 were identified retrospectively using ICD10 codes J44.0,1,8,9. Patients with suitable CT scans were graded for severity of bronchiectasis, emphysema and BWT on a 5 point scale (0-absent, 1-minor, 2-mild, 3-moderate, 4-severe). Results: 406 patients (71 ± 11 years, 56\% male, FEV1 52 ± 23\% predicted) were included; 278 (69\%) patients had bronchiectasis: minor, 112 (40\%); mild, 81 (29\%); moderate, 62 (22\%); severe 23 (8\%). Bronchiectasis severity correlated with severity of BWT (p {$<$} 0.001) but not emphysema (p = 0.090). Bronchiectasis independently determined sputum isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Odds ratio (OR) 1.39 (95\% CI 1.07 to 1.80), p = 0.013) and atypical mycobacteria (OR 2.44 (95\% CI 1.04 to 5.69), p = 0.040), annual respiratory admissions (p = 0.044) and inpatient days (p {$<$} 0.001), but did not predict survival (p = 0.256). Conclusions: Radiographic bronchiectasis in COPD patients is associated with increased respiratory infection and hospitalisation, independent of coexisting emphysema and BWT. COPD-related bronchiectasis is therefore an important diagnosis with potential implications for treatment.},

  abstract = {AIM: To describe the time trends, age and sex distribution of death from diabetes mellitus (E10-E14) as a significant part of endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-E90), during 1996-2014 in the Slovak regions, and to estimate the influence of social characteristics on mortality. METHODS: Secondary data on deaths during 1996-2014 were gathered from the National Health Information Center in the Slovak Republic. The total crude death rate per 100,000 of the standard Slovak population and age-standardized death rate per 100,000 of the standard European population were calculated by direct standardization. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Deaths from diabetes mellitus account for 91.6\% of deaths registered in the endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases Chapter. The age-standardized death rate per 100,000 of inhabitants decreased from 19.2 in 1996 to 15.3 in 2014 in the Slovak Republic, although a massive increase of up to 32.5 was reported in 1999. The highest age-standardized death rates per 100,000 inhabitants were typical for the Košice, Nitra and Trenčín regions. On the other hand, the lowest counts were recorded in the Bratislava region. Mortality from diabetes mellitus starts to be evident in the 45-49 year age-group in both sexes. The median age of death for women is lower in the 75-79 year age-group in comparison to men although the total crude death rate for men in lower age groups is higher. After age 80 the situation is reversed. The odds of dying due to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases decreases by 0.4\% each year. The odds of dying are lower by 17\% and 12.3\%, respectively, in the Žilina and Prešov regions compared to Bratislava region. Women have a higher probability of dying by 38\% in contrast to men, and married couples by 16.7\% than singles. Age is proved to be an insignificant factor. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the declining trend of mortality from diabetes mellitus, it is necessary to reduce the risk of its incidence by healthier food consumption and physical activity.},

Little is known about the association between the course of depression and mortality.Methods. In an initially non-depressed cohort (N = 325) and a depressed cohort (N = 327), depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) at eight successive waves over a period of 3 years. Both cohorts were then followed with respect to mortality status for up to 3·5 additional years. Clinical course types as well as theoretical course type parameters (basic symptom levels, increases in symptoms and instability over time) were distinguished to study the effect of the course of depression on mortality.Results. Contrary to transient states of depression, both chronic depression and chronic intermittent depression predicted mortality at follow-up. Additionally, evidence was found that the effect on mortality is related to severity of depression; high basic symptom levels and increases in symptoms over time were predictive of mortality. A high degree of instability over time was not associated with mortality.Conclusions. Since the mortality effect of depression is a function of both exposure time and symptom severity, more attention should be paid to the treatment of depression in order to prevent severe longstanding depression.},

This study quantified the contributions of body weight, physical inactivity and dietary factors to the prevalence of hypertension in Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (UK) and USA. METHODS: Distributions of blood pressure (BP) and risk factors in Western populations were obtained from nationwide surveys. The effect of risk factors on BP was assessed by meta-regression analysis of randomized trials, published between 1966 and March 2001. Population attributable risk percentages (PAR\%) for hypertension (i.e. systolic BP {$>$} or =140 mmHg) were computed for all risk factors in the five countries. RESULTS: Being overweight made the largest contribution to hypertension, with PAR\% between 11\% (Italy) and 25\% (USA). PAR\% were 5-13\% for physical inactivity, 9-17\% for high sodium intake, 4-17\% for low potassium intake and 4-8\% for low magnesium intake. The impact of alcohol was small (2-3\%) in all populations. PAR\% varied among populations for inadequate intake of calcium (2-8\%), magnesium (4-8\%), coffee (0-9\%) and fish fatty acids (3-16\%). CONCLUSIONS: Diet and lifestyle have a substantial impact on hypertension in Western societies, with being overweight, physical inactivity, high sodium intake and low potassium intake being the main contributors. The relative significance of different risk factors varies among populations, which is important for preventative strategies.},

Methods From all candidates for deceased donor liver transplantation in Japan between 2007 and 2015, 1014 adult patients with CTP-C cirrhosis were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The hazard ratio (HR) of factors associated with mortality was estimated by the Cox proportional hazard model. The survival probabilities were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis and the log–rank test. Results Median survival time of the entire cohort was 475 days. Univariate analysis identified age, CTP, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) as significant variables associated with mortality and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as a close-to-significant variable. Multivariate analysis revealed that age-adjusted mortality risk increased by 59\% and 12\% per 1 score step up in CTP and MELD scores, respectively. The HRs for HBV infection and PBC were significant after adjustment for age and CTP score, and they showed a 26\% lower risk and an 83\% higher risk than hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, respectively. After adjustment for age and MELD score, the HR was also significant for HBV infection, but lost statistical significance for PBC. The survival curves were well stratified by both CTP or MELD score and revealed significant difference in both HBV infection and PBC as compared to HCV infection. Conclusions In patients with CTP-C cirrhosis, CTP and MELD scores could well stratify the patients’ survival, and HBV infection and PBC as etiologies have an impact on survival.},

  abstract = {Objectives We compared long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) of never-smokers, pre-AMI quitters, post-AMI quitters, and persistent smokers and assessed whether cigarette reduction among persistent smokers is associated with lower mortality. Background Quitting smoking has been shown to improve outcome after AMI. However, longitudinal cohort data with repeated assessments of smoking and information on multiple confounders are lacking. Moreover, little is known about the importance, if any, of reductions in the amount smoked. Methods Consecutive patients ≤65 years of age, discharged from 8 hospitals in central Israel after first AMI in 1992 to 1993, were followed through 2005. Extensive data, including self-reported smoking habits, were obtained at baseline and 4 times during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to assess the hazard ratios (HRs) for death associated with smoking categories modeled as time-dependent variables. Results At baseline, smokers were younger, more likely to be male, and had a lower prevalence of hypertension and diabetes than nonsmokers. Over a median follow-up of 13.2 years, 427 deaths occurred in 1,521 patients. The multivariable-adjusted HRs for mortality were 0.57 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43 to 0.76) for never-smokers, 0.50 (95\% CI: 0.36 to 0.68) for pre-AMI quitters, and 0.63 (95\% CI: 0.48 to 0.82) for post-AMI quitters, compared with persistent smokers. Among persistent smokers, upon multivariable adjustment including pre-AMI intensity, each reduction of 5 cigarettes smoked daily after AMI was associated with an 18\% decline in mortality risk (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions Smoking cessation either before or after AMI is associated with improved survival. Among persistent smokers, reducing intensity after AMI appears to be beneficial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking, alcohol use, and obesity appear to increase the risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but to the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have assessed their impact on NHL prognosis. METHODS: The association between prediagnosis cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and body mass index (BMI) and overall survival was evaluated in 1286 patients enrolled through population-based registries in the United States from 1998 through 2000. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for clinical and demographic factors. RESULTS: Through 2007, 442 patients had died (34\%), and the median follow-up for surviving patients was 7.7 years. Compared with never smokers, former (HR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.26) and current (HR, 1.50; 95\% CI, 0.97-2.29) smokers had poorer survival, and poorer survival was found to be positively associated with smoking duration, number of cigarettes smoked per day, pack-years of smoking, and shorter time since quitting (all P {$<$}0.01). Alcohol use was associated with poorer survival (P = 0.03); compared with nonusers. Those drinking {$>$}43.1 g/week (median intake among drinkers) had poorer survival (HR, 1.55; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.27), whereas those drinkers consuming less than this amount demonstrated no survival disadvantage (HR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 0.75-1.71). Greater BMI was associated with poorer survival (P = 0.046), but the survival disadvantage was only noted among obese individuals (HR, 1.32 for BMI ≥30 vs BMI 20-24.9; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.70). These results held for lymphoma-specific survival and were broadly similar for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: NHL patients who smoked, consumed alcohol, or were obese before diagnosis were found to have a poorer overall and lymphoma-specific survival.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One third of cadaveric kidney transplant recipients suffer graft loss within five years of transplantation. Non-immunologic factors that predict mortality among non-transplant patients also may be potentially modifiable risk factors for mortality among patients with transplant failure. METHODS: Applying multivariate survival analysis to data from the United States Renal Data System, we determined the effect of immunologic or transplant related factors and non-immunologic factors on mortality in patients who initiated dialysis after kidney transplant failure in the United States between April 1995 and September 1998. RESULTS: A total of 4741 patients were followed for a median +/- standard deviation of 15 +/- 11 months after initiation of dialysis after transplant failure. The majority of the 1016 (21\%) deaths were due to cardiac (36\%) or infectious (17\%) causes. Patients in the following groups had an increased risk for all-cause mortality: older patients [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.04 per year, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.03-1.04], women (HR = 1.31, 95\% CI 1.10-1.56), patients of white race (HR = 1.94, 95\% CI 1.32-2.84), patients with diabetes (HR = 1.76, 95\% CI 1.43-2.16), peripheral vascular disease (HR = 1.94, 95\% CI 1.54-2.43), congestive heart failure (HR = 1.26, 95\% CI 1.05-1.53), drug use (HR = 2.23; 95\% CI 1.08-4.60), smokers (HR = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.01-1.81), first transplant recipients (HR = 1.32, 95\% CI 1.02-1.69), and patients with a higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at dialysis initiation (HR = 1.04 per mL/min higher, 95\% CI 1.02-1.06). Those with private insurance (HR = 0.67, 95\% CI 0.49-0.93) and higher serum albumin (HR = 0.73 per g/dL higher, 95\% CI 0.64-0.83) had a decreased risk for all-cause mortality. Acute rejection, antibody induction, donor source, duration of graft survival and the maximum attained GFR during transplantation did not predict all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Non-immunologic factors predicted mortality among patients with transplant failure but immunologic and transplant related factors did not. Prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of co-morbid conditions and the complications of chronic kidney disease may improve the survival of patients with transplant failure.},

Survival was determined using separate multivariate nonproportional hazards analyses in low-, intermediate- and high-risk cardiovascular risk patients. Compared to wait-listed patients with similar cardiovascular risk, standard criteria (SCD) and expanded criteria (ECD) recipients had a higher risk of death in the perioperative and early-posttransplant period. In contrast, low and intermediate risk living donor (LD) recipients had an immediate survival advantage compared to similar risk wait-listed patients. In all risk groups, transplantation was associated with a long-term survival advantage compared to dialysis, but there were marked differences in time to equal risk of death, and time to equal survival by donor type. For example, survival in high-risk recipients of an LD, SCD and ECD transplant became equal to that in similar risk wait-listed patients 130, 368 and 521 days after transplantation. Early posttransplant mortality risk is eliminated in low- and intermediate-risk patients, and markedly reduced in high-risk patients with LD transplantation.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with pulmonary disease and worse lung function, but the relationship of lung function with survival in HIV is unknown., Objectives: To determine whether lung function is associated with all-cause mortality in HIV-infected individuals., Methods: HIV-infected participants from cohorts in three locations underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and determination of single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DlCO) in 2008–2009, computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the chest for quantitative emphysema and airway measures, and echocardiography for estimated left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and tricuspid regurgitant velocity. Bivariate analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether decreased lung function was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality. Models were adjusted for covariates including age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, self-reported hepatitis C status, HIV viral levels, CD4+ T-cell counts, hemoglobin, antiretroviral therapy, and illicit drug use., Results: Overall, 396 HIV-infected participants underwent pulmonary function testing. Thirty-two participants (8\%) died during a median follow-up period of 69 months. A post-bronchodilator FEV1-to-FVC ratio less than 0.7 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.47; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–5.58) and a DlCO less than 60\% (HR, 2.28; 95\% CI, 1.08–4.82) were independently associated with worse mortality. Also, hepatitis C (HR, 2.68; 95\% CI, 1.22–5.89) and baseline plasma HIV RNA level (HR per ln RNA copies/ml, 1.50; 95\% CI, 1.22–1.86) were associated with mortality in HIV-infected participants. The only CT or echocardiographic measure associated with greater mortality in univariate analysis was greater wall thickness of medium-sized airways (HR for wall area percent, 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.00–1.18; P\,=\,0.051), but none of the CT or echocardiogram measures were associated with mortality in multivariable analysis., Conclusions: Airflow obstruction and impaired diffusing capacity appear to be associated with all-cause mortality in HIV-infected persons over an average of 6 years of follow-up. These data highlight the importance of lung dysfunction in HIV-infected persons and should be confirmed in larger cohorts and with extended follow-up periods., Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00869544, NCT01326572).},

  abstract = {Risk factors for prostate cancer could differ for various subgroups, such as for “aggressive” and “non-aggressive” cancers or by grade or stage. Determinants of mortality could differ from those for incidence. Using data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, we re-examined 10 factors (cigarette smoking history, physical activity, BMI, family history of prostate cancer, race, height, total energy consumption, and intakes of calcium, tomato sauce and α-linolenic acid) using multivariable Cox regression in relation to multiple subcategories for prostate cancer risk. These were factors that we previously found to be predictors of prostate cancer incidence or advanced prostate cancer in this cohort, and that have some support in the literature. In this analysis, only 4 factors had a clear statistically significant association with overall incident prostate cancer: African–American race, positive family history, higher tomato sauce intake (inversely) and α-linolenic acid intake. In contrast, for fatal prostate cancer, recent smoking history, taller height, higher BMI, family history, and high intakes of total energy, calcium and α-linolenic acid were associated with a statistically significant increased risk. Higher vigorous physical activity level was associated with lower risk. In relation to these risk factors, advanced stage at diagnosis was a good surrogate for fatal prostate cancer, but high-grade (Gleason ≥ 7 or Gleason ≥ 8) was not. Only for high calcium intake was there a close correspondence for associations among high-grade cancer, advanced and fatal prostate cancer. Tomato sauce (inversely) and α-linolenic acid (positively) intakes were strong predictors of advanced cancer among those with low-grade cancers at diagnosis. Although the proportion of advanced stage cancers was much lower after PSA screening began, risk factors for advanced stage prostate cancers were similar in the pre-PSA and PSA era. The complexity of the clinical and pathologic manifestations of prostate cancer must be considered in the design and interpretation of studies.},

Design Cohort study in the UK with routinely collected data between January 1987 and March 2011. Setting 310 general practices that contributed to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. Participants 4 cohorts who reached the age of 60, 65, 70, or 75\hspace{0.25em}years between 1987 and 2011 included 16\hspace{0.25em}744, 43\hspace{0.25em}528, 73\hspace{0.25em}728, and 76\hspace{0.25em}392 participants, respectively. Participants with a history of AMI were matched on sex, year of birth, and general practice to 3 controls each. Outcome measures The hazard of all-cause mortality associated with AMI was calculated by a multilevel Cox's proportional hazards regression, adjusted for sex, year of birth, socioeconomic status, angina, heart failure, other cardiovascular conditions, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, alcohol consumption, body mass index, smoking status, coronary revascularisation, prescription of β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, aspirin, or statins, and general practice. Results Compared with no history of AMI by age 60, 65, 70, or 75, having had 1 AMI was associated with an adjusted hazard of mortality of 1.80 (95\% CI 1.60 to 2.02), 1.71 (1.59 to 1.84), 1.50 (1.42 to 1.59), or 1.45 (1.38 to 1.53), respectively, and having had multiple AMIs with a hazard of 1.92 (1.60 to 2.29), 1.87 (1.68 to 2.07), 1.66 (1.53 to 1.80), or 1.63 (1.51 to 1.76), respectively. Survival was better after statins (HR range across the 4 cohorts 0.74–0.81), β-blockers (0.79–0.85), or coronary revascularisation (in first 5\hspace{0.25em}years) (0.72–0.80); unchanged after calcium-channel blockers (1.00–1.07); and worse after aspirin (1.05–1.10) or ACE inhibitors (1.10–1.25). Conclusions The hazard of death after AMI is less than reported by previous studies, and standard treatments of aspirin or ACE inhibitors prescription may be of little benefit or even cause harm.},

Patients with two or more comorbidities and patients with less than two comorbidities differed in overall survival (71.7 versus 90.2 months; P{$<$}0.001) and progression-free survival (21.0 versus 31.5 months; P{$<$}0.01). After adjustment for other prognostic factors and treatment, comorbidity maintained its independent prognostic value in a multivariate Cox regression analysis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the major cause of death in patients with two or more comorbidities. Disease control in patients with two or more comorbidities was better with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide than with fludarabine treatment, but not with fludarabine compared to chlorambucil treatment. These results give insight into interactions between comorbidity and therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and suggest that durable control of the hematologic disease is most critical to improve overall outcome of patients with increased comorbidity.

  abstract = {Kaplan-Meier estimate is one of the best options to be used to measure the fraction of subjects living for a certain amount of time after treatment. In clinical trials or community trials, the effect of an intervention is assessed by measuring the number of subjects survived or saved after that intervention over a period of time. The time starting from a defined point to the occurrence of a given event, for example death is called as survival time and the analysis of group data as survival analysis. This can be affected by subjects under study that are uncooperative and refused to be remained in the study or when some of the subjects may not experience the event or death before the end of the study, although they would have experienced or died if observation continued, or we lose touch with them midway in the study. We label these situations as censored observations. The Kaplan-Meier estimate is the simplest way of computing the survival over time in spite of all these difficulties associated with subjects or situations. The survival curve can be created assuming various situations. It involves computing of probabilities of occurrence of event at a certain point of time and multiplying these successive probabilities by any earlier computed probabilities to get the final estimate. This can be calculated for two groups of subjects and also their statistical difference in the survivals. This can be used in Ayurveda research when they are comparing two drugs and looking for survival of subjects.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aim Diabetes mellitus has been linked to cirrhosis-related mortality in Western populations, but less is known about this relationship in Asian populations. We studied the impact of diabetes on the risk of cirrhosis mortality in a population-based cohort among Chinese in Singapore. Methods We used data collected and analysed from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a prospective community-based cohort of 63 275 subjects aged 45–74 years during enrolment between 1993 and 1998. Information on diet, lifestyle and medical history was collected via structured questionnaire. Mortality cases from cirrhosis in the cohort were identified via linkage with nationwide death registry up to 31 December 2014. Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate the associations with adjustment for risk factors of cirrhosis. Results After a mean follow-up of 16.9 years, there were 133 deaths from cirrhosis. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.04–3.83), and for both viral (HR: 2.20; 95\% CI: 1.18–4.11) and non-viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis mortality (HR: 3.06; 95\% CI: 2.13–4.41). The association between diabetes and non-viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis mortality was stronger among participants of body mass index (BMI) less than 23 kg/m2 (HR: 7.11; 95\% CI: 3.42–14.79) compared to heavier individuals (HR: 2.28; 95\% CI: 1.20–4.35) (Pinteraction=0.02). Conclusion Diabetes is a risk factor for cirrhosis mortality, especially for non-viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis in population with BMI considered low or normal in Asia.},

  abstract = {Despite myriad efforts among social scientists, epidemiologists, and clinicians to identify variables with strong linkages to mortality, few researchers have evaluated statistically the relative strength of a comprehensive set of predictors of survival. Here, we determine the strongest predictors of five-year mortality in four national, prospective studies of older adults. We analyze nationally representative surveys of older adults in four countries with similar levels of life expectancy: England (n = 6113, ages 52+), the US (n = 2023, ages 50+), Costa Rica (n = 2694, ages 60+), and Taiwan (n = 1032, ages 53+). Each survey includes a broad set of demographic, social, health, and biological variables that have been shown previously to predict mortality. We rank 57 predictors, 25 of which are available in all four countries, net of age and sex. We use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and assess robustness with additional discrimination measures. We demonstrate consistent findings across four countries with different cultural traditions, levels of economic development, and epidemiological transitions. Self-reported measures of instrumental activities of daily living limitations, mobility limitations, and overall self-assessed health are among the top predictors in all four samples. C-reactive protein, additional inflammatory markers, homocysteine, serum albumin, three performance assessments (gait speed, grip strength, and chair stands), and exercise frequency also discriminate well between decedents and survivors when these measures are available. We identify several promising candidates that could improve mortality prediction for both population-based and clinical populations. Better prognostic tools are likely to provide researchers with new insights into the behavioral and biological pathways that underlie social stratification in health and may allow physicians to have more informed discussions with patients about end-of-life treatment and priorities.},

In preparation for this, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer established its Lung Cancer Staging Project in 1998. The recommendations of this committee for changes to the T, N, and M descriptors have been published. This report contains the proposals for the new stage groupings. Data were contributed from 46 sources in more than 19 countries. Adequate data were available on 67,725 cases of non-small cell lung cancer treated by all modalities of care between 1990 and 2000. The recommendations for changes to the T, N, and M descriptors were incorporated into TNM subsets. Candidate stage groupings were developed on a training subset and tested in a validation subset. The suggestions include additional cutoffs for tumor size, with tumors {$>$}7 cm moving from T2 to T3; reassigning the category given to additional pulmonary nodules in some locations; and reclassifying pleural effusion as an M descriptor. In addition, it is suggested that T2b N0 M0 cases be moved from stage IB to stage IIA, T2a N1 M0 cases from stage IIB to stage IIA, and T4 N0–1 M0 cases from stage IIIB to stage IIIA. Such changes, if accepted, will involve a reassessment of existing treatment algorithms. However, they are based on an intensive and validated analysis of the largest database to date. The proposed changes would improve the alignment of TNM stage with prognosis and, in certain subsets, with treatment.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors and develop a prognostic factor-based risk stratification model for disease-specific survival (DSS) in a radical cystectomy (RC) series.MethodsThe patient cohort comprised 194 consecutive patients with bladder cancer treated with RC. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors for DSS. A risk stratification model was developed based on the relative risks (RRs) of DSS.ResultsMedian follow-up period was 26.8 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DSS were 88.0, 74.0, and 64.9\%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, pathological T (pT) (≥pT2), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), non-urothelial carcinoma component, surgical margin (SM), and lymph node metastases (pN) were significantly associated with poor prognosis. In the multivariate analysis, pT (≥pT2), LVI, and SM were independent factors for predicting poor prognosis. Based on these results, patients were stratified into three risk groups: low (RR = 1.00–3.626), intermediate (5.860–9.826), and high (21.24). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 96.9, 85.1, and 85.1\% in the low-risk group, 83.0, 63.4, and 43.8\% in the intermediate group, and 51.0, 19.4, and 19.4\% in the high-risk group, respectively. The differences among these groups were significant.ConclusionsIn our RC series, pT (≥pT2), LVI, and SM were independent prognostic factors. This information may be useful to identify patients with poor prognosis, who might be good candidates for innovative treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Current research is inconclusive regarding the effect of obesity on outcomes after a prostate cancer diagnosis. The objective of this study was to examine associations between obesity and the risks of developing metastasis or prostate cancer-specific mortality in a population-based cohort of men with prostate cancer. METHODS Seven hundred fifty-two middle-aged men with prostate cancer who were enrolled in a case-control study and remain under long-term follow-up for disease progression and mortality formed the study cohort. Body mass index (BMI) in the year before diagnosis was obtained at the time of initial interview. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) of prostate cancer metastasis and mortality associated with obesity, controlling for age, race, smoking status, Gleason score, stage at diagnosis, diagnostic prostate-specific antigen level, and primary treatment. RESULTS Obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) was associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer mortality (HR, 2.64; 95\% CI, 1.18–5.92). Among men who were diagnosed with local- or regional-stage disease, obesity also was associated with an increased risk of developing metastasis (HR, 3.61; 95\% CI, 1.73–7.51). Associations generally were consistent across strata defined by Gleason score (2–6 or 7 [3 + 4] vs 7 [4 + 3] or 8–10), stage (local vs regional/distant for mortality), and primary treatment (androgen-deprivation therapy use: yes vs no). CONCLUSIONS Obesity at the time of diagnosis was associated with increased risks of prostate cancer metastasis and death. The increased risk of prostate cancer death or metastasis associated with obesity largely was independent of key clinical prognostic factors at diagnosis.

  abstract = {Our study assessed whether rising age, socioeconomic status (SES) and the presence of serious comorbidity affected treatment choice and survival in a population-based series of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) in The Netherlands. Therefore, a consecutive series was studied, including all patients diagnosed with MIBC between 1995 and 2009 in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, preceding centralization of cystectomy. The independent effects of age, SES and serious comorbidity on therapy choice and their effects on overall survival were estimated by multivariate logistic regression and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, respectively. Out of the 2,445 patients, 38\% were aged ≥75 years at diagnosis and 63\% had at least one serious comorbid condition. Higher age and serious comorbidity were independent predictors for abstaining from cystectomy, where SES was not (61–74 vs. ≤60: odds ratio [OR], 0.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.6–1.0; ≥75 vs. ≤60: OR, 0.1; 95\% CI,0.1–0.2; one comorbid condition vs. none: OR, 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.5–0.9; two vs. none: OR, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.5–0.8). Patients undergoing cystectomy, external beam radiotherapy or interstitial radiotherapy survived longer independent of age, SES and serious comorbidity (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.4; 95\% CI: 0.4–0.5; HR: 0.8; 95\% CI: 0.7–0.9; HR: 0.4; 95\% CI: 0.3–0.5, respectively). Consequently, preceding centralization of cystectomy, higher age and serious comorbidity were independent predictors for abstaining from cystectomy owing to an expected high rate of short-term medical problems. As cystectomy is associated with a better survival, independently of age, SES and serious comorbidity, it can be questioned whether cystectomy has been underutilised in elderly and in patients with serious comorbidity. Centralization might be a solution for this suggested underutilisation.},

  abstract = {AbstractBackground:Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair aims to prevent premature death from AAA rupture. Elective repair is currently recommended when AAA diameter reaches 5.5 cm (men) and 5.0 cm (women). Applying population-based indications may not be appropriate for individual patient decisions, as the optimal indication is likely to differ between patients based on age and comorbidities.Objective:To develop an Aneurysm Repair Decision Aid (ARDA) to indicate when elective AAA repair optimises survival for individual patients and to assess the cost-effectiveness and associated uncertainty of elective repair at the aneurysm diameter recommended by the ARDA compared with current practice.Data sources:The UK Vascular Governance North West and National Vascular Database provided individual patient data to develop predictive models for perioperative mortality and survival. Data from published literature were used to model AAA growth and risk of rupture. The cost-effectiveness analysis used data from published literature and from local and national databases.Methods:A combination of systematic review methods and clinical registries were used to provide data to populate models and inform the structure of the ARDA. Discrete event simulation (DES) was used to model the patient journey from diagnosis to death and synthesised data were used to estimate patient outcomes and costs for elective repair at alternative aneurysm diameters. Eight patient clinical scenarios (vignettes) were used as exemplars. The DES structure was validated by clinical and statistical experts. The economic evaluation estimated costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the NHS, social care provider and patient perspective over a lifetime horizon. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in the data and the value for money of ARDA-based decisions. The ARDA outcome measures include perioperative mortality risk, annual risk of rupture, 1-, 5- and 10-year survival, postoperative long-term survival, median life expectancy and predicted time to current threshold for aneurysm repair. The primary economic measure was the ICER using the QALY as the measure of health benefit.Results:The analysis demonstrated it is feasible to build and run a complex clinical decision aid using DES. The model results support current guidelines for most vignettes but suggest that earlier repair may be effective in younger, fitter patients and ongoing surveillance may be effective in elderly patients with comorbidities. The model adds information to support decisions for patients with aneurysms outside current indications. The economic evaluation suggests that using the ARDA compared with current guidelines could be cost-effective but there is a high level of uncertainty.Limitations:Lack of high-quality long-term data to populate all sections of the model meant that there is high uncertainty about the long-term clinical and economic consequences of repair. Modelling assumptions were necessary and the developed survival models require external validation.Conclusions:The ARDA provides detailed information on the potential consequences of AAA repair or a decision not to repair that may be helpful to vascular surgeons and their patients in reaching informed decisions. Further research is required to reduce uncertainty about key data, including reintervention following AAA repair, and assess the acceptability and feasibility of the ARDA for use in routine clinical practice.Funding:The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of recipient age exceeding 60 years on early and long-term outcomes after LT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study comprised data of 786 patients after primary LT performed at a single center between January 2005 and October 2012. Patients over and under 60 years of age were compared with respect to baseline characteristics and outcomes: postoperative mortality (90-day) and 5-year patient (PS) and graft (GS) survival. Associations between recipient age exceeding 60 years and LT results were assessed in multiple Cox regression models. RESULTS: Recipients older than 60 years (n=107; 13.6\%) were characterized by more frequent hepatitis C virus infections (p{$<$}0.001), malignancies (p{$<$}0.001), and cardiovascular comorbidities (p{$<$}0.001); less frequent primary sclerosing cholangitis (p=0.002) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (p{$<$}0.001); lower Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD; p=0.043); and increased donor age (p=0.012). Fiveyear PS of older and younger recipients was 72.7\% and 80.6\% (p=0.538), while the corresponding rates of GS were 70.3\% and 77.5\% (p=0.548), respectively. Recipient age exceeding 60 years was not significantly associated with postoperative mortality (p=0.215), PS (p=0.525) and GS (p=0.572) in multivariate analyses. The list of independent predictors comprised MELD (p{$<$}0.001) for postoperative mortality; malignancies (p=0.003) and MELD (p{$<$}0.001) for PS; and malignancies (p=0.003), MELD (p{$<$}0.001) and donor age (p=0.017) for GS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite major differences between elderly and young patients, chronological age exceeding 60 years alone should not be considered as a contraindication for LT.},

The score holds for all acquired hematological disorders, for allogeneic and autologous HSCT (score 0–5), is independent of the HSCT technology and is valid for standard or reduced intensity conditioning. Survival is uniformly worse for older patients, transplanted in advanced disease stage after a long-time interval and with a mismatched donor than for younger patients, transplanted soon in early stage with a well matched donor. Additional risk factors such as performance score, CMV serostatus or cytokine polymorphisms improve prediction but to different extents for low or high-risk patients. Comparative assessment of disease risk and global pre-transplant risk should guide decisions for each patient with his/her specific disease between HSCT and a non-transplant approach and replace the traditional ‘donor vs no donor’ with such a risk-adapted individualized strategy.},

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors in the mid-2000s radically changed the management of RCC. These targeted treatments superseded immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon. The pendulum now appears to be shifting back towards immunotherapy, with the evidence of prolonged overall survival of patients with metastatic RCC on treatment with the anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand monoclonal antibody, nivolumab. Clinical prognostic criteria aid prediction of relapse risk for resected localised disease. Unfortunately, for patients at high risk of relapse, no adjuvant treatment has yet shown benefit, although further trials are yet to report. Clinical prognostic models also have a role in the management of advanced disease; now there is a pressing need for predictive biomarkers to direct therapy. Treatment selection for metastatic disease is currently based on histology, prognostic group and patient preference based on side effect profile. In this article, we review the current medical and surgical management of localised, oligometastatic and advanced RCC, including side effect management and the evidence base for management of poor-risk and non-clear cell disease. We discuss recent results from clinical trials and how these are likely to shape future practice and a renaissance of immunotherapy for renal cell cancer.},

BACKGROUND: Frailty status impacts prognosis in older adults with heart disease; however, the impact of frailty on prognosis after TAVR is unknown. METHODS: Gait speed, grip strength, serum albumin, and activities of daily living status were collected at baseline and used to derive a frailty score among patients who underwent TAVR procedures at a single large-volume institution. The cohort was dichotomized on the basis of median frailty score into frail and not frail groups. The impact of frailty on procedural outcomes (stroke, bleeding, vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and mortality at 30 days) and 1-year mortality was evaluated. RESULTS: Frailty status was assessed in 159 subjects who underwent TAVR (age 86 ± 8 years, Society of Thoracic Surgery Risk Score 12 ± 4). Baseline frailty score was not associated with conventionally ascertained clinical variables or Society of Thoracic Surgery score. Although high frailty score was associated with a longer post-TAVR hospital stay when compared with lower frailty score (9 ± 6 days vs. 6 ± 5 days, respectively, p = 0.004), there were no significant crude associations between frailty status and procedural outcomes, suggesting adequacy of the standard selection process for identifying patients at risk for periprocedural complications after TAVR. Frailty status was independently associated with increased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 3.5, 95\% confidence interval: 1.4 to 8.5, p = 0.007) after TAVR. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was not associated with increased periprocedural complications in patients selected as candidates to undergo TAVR but was associated with increased 1-year mortality after TAVR. Further studies will evaluate the independent value of this frailty composite in older adults with aortic stenosis.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Danish National Diabetes Register was established in 2006 and is assumed to cover all patients with diabetes, alive as of the end of 1996, and all subsequent new cases. The present study is based on the content of the register as of July 3, 2013 (n=497,232 patients). Using the personal identification code assigned to all Danish inhabitants, all available supplementary information from the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish Civil Registration Service was used to define the date of diagnosis of diabetes and the first date of experiencing complications (grouped according to impact and severity). RESULTS: During the period of 2000 to 2011, the incidence rate of diabetes increased approximately 5\% annually. During the same period, decreasing trends were observed for both the rates of progression in complications and of the complication-specific mortality. During the same period, the prevalence of diabetes doubled. CONCLUSION: The increasing prevalence of diabetes in Denmark is driven by increasing incidence combined with decreasing morbidity and mortality in the population of patients with diabetes. These mechanisms will be explored further as part of the Diabetes Impact Study 2013, together with investigations into the socioeconomic and health economic aspects of diabetes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large reductions in diabetes complications have altered diabetes-related morbidity in the USA. It is unclear whether similar trends have occurred in causes of death. METHODS: Using data from the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality files from 1985 to 2015, we estimated age-specific death rates and proportional mortality from all causes, vascular causes, cancers, and non-vascular, non-cancer causes among US adults by diabetes status. FINDINGS: From 1988-94, to 2010-15, all-cause death rates declined by 20\% every 10 years among US adults with diabetes (from 23·1 [95\% CI 20·1-26·0] to 15·2 [14·6-15·8] per 1000 person-years), while death from vascular causes decreased 32\% every 10 years (from 11·0 [9·2-12·2] to 5·2 [4·8-5·6] per 1000 person-years), deaths from cancers decreased 16\% every 10 years (from 4·4 [3·2-5·5] to 3·0 [2·8-3·3] per 1000 person-years), and the rate of non-vascular, non-cancer deaths declined by 8\% every 10 years (from 7·7 [6·3-9·2] to 7·1 [6·6-7·5]). Death rates also declined significantly among people without diagnosed diabetes for all four major mortality categories. However, the declines in death rates were significantly greater among people with diabetes for all-causes (pinteraction{$<$}0·0001), vascular causes (pinteraction=0·0214), and non-vascular, non-cancer causes (pinteration{$<$}0·0001), as differences in all-cause and vascular disease death between people with and without diabetes were reduced by about a half. Among people with diabetes, all-cause mortality rates declined most in men and adults aged 65-74 years of age, and there was no decline in death rates among adults aged 20-44 years. The different magnitude of changes in cause-specific mortality led to large changes in the proportional mortality. The proportion of total deaths among adults with diabetes from vascular causes declined from 47·8\% (95\% CI 38·9-58·8) in 1988-94 to 34·1\% (31·4-37·1) in 2010-15; this decline was offset by large increases in the proportion of deaths from non-vascular, non-cancer causes, from 33·5\% (26·7-42·1) to 46·5\% (43·3-50·0). The proportion of deaths caused by cancer was relatively stable over time, ranging from 16\% to 20\%. INTERPRETATION: Declining rates of vascular disease mortality are leading to a diversification of forms of diabetes-related mortality with implications for clinical management, prevention, and disease monitoring.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared 3-year death rates of four consecutive nationally representative samples (1997-1998, 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004) of U.S. adults aged 18 years and older using data from the National Health Interview Surveys linked to National Death Index. RESULTS: Among diabetic adults, the CVD death rate declined by 40\% (95\% CI 23-54) and all-cause mortality declined by 23\% (10-35) between the earliest and latest samples. There was no difference in the rates of decline in mortality between diabetic men and women. The excess CVD mortality rate associated with diabetes (i.e., compared with nondiabetic adults) decreased by 60\% (from 5.8 to 2.3 CVD deaths per 1,000) while the excess all-cause mortality rate declined by 44\% (from 10.8 to 6.1 deaths per 1,000). CONCLUSIONS: Death rates among both U.S. men and women with diabetes declined substantially between 1997 and 2006, reducing the absolute difference between adults with and without diabetes. These encouraging findings, however, suggest that diabetes prevalence is likely to rise in the future if diabetes incidence is not curtailed.},

  abstract = {Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis are common diagnoses in patients attending chest clinics, but little is known about the epidemiology of these diseases. We used data from a general practice database to provide information on the current incidence of IPF and sarcoidosis in the UK. Methods Data were extracted for all patients with a diagnosis of IPF or sarcoidosis between 1991 and 2003. The whole population of the database was used to calculate disease incidence stratified by age, sex, region, and time period. Poisson regression was used to compare the incidence between populations and Cox regression was used to compare survival between populations. Results 920 cases of IPF (mean age 71\hspace{0.25em}years, 62\% male) and 1019 cases of sarcoidosis (mean age 47\hspace{0.25em}years, 47\% male) were identified. The overall incidence rate per 100\,000\hspace{0.25em}person‐years was 4.6 for IPF and 5.0 for sarcoidosis. The incidence of IPF increased progressively between 1991 and 2003 (p{$<$}0.00001), and was highest in Northern England and Scotland (p{$<$}0.0001). The survival of patients with IPF was stable over time. In contrast, the incidence of sarcoidosis was highest in London, West Midlands and Northern Ireland and remained stable over time. Conclusions The incidence of IPF has more than doubled between 1990 and 2003; this is not due to the ageing of the UK population or an increased ascertainment of milder cases. The incidence of sarcoidosis has not changed during this time period. Our findings suggest that more than 4000 new cases of IPF and 3000 new cases of sarcoidosis are currently diagnosed each year in the UK.},

Most patients received a preoperative intracavitary insertion (3500–4000 mgh to the uterus and a 6500 cGy surface dose to the upper vagina) followed by a TAH-BSO within 1–2 weeks. Some patients received postoperative external beam irradiation (2000 cGy whole pelvis and an additional 3000 cGy to the parametria, with a midline stepwedge) when factors such as deep myometrial invasion were present. Occasionally patients were treated with a preoperative intracavitary insertion and preoperative external beam irradiation (2000 cGy whole pelvis). The 5-year progression-free survivals by FIGO (1988) surgical stage were 93\% for IA, 90\% for IB, and 91\% for Stage 1C. An analysis of multiple variables was performed to ascertain their prognostic significance.

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Population-based studies of the clinical course of autoimmune hepatitis are scarce. We conducted a nationwide study of incidence, prevalence, prognosis, and causes of death of autoimmune hepatitis in Denmark. Methods From nationwide healthcare registries we identified all Danish citizens diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis in 1994–2012 and their liver biopsy data. We followed patients through January 2013 and examined age-standardized incidence and prevalence, mortality, prognostic factors, risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and causes of death. We used Cox regression to compare patients’ mortality relative to a gender- and age-matched general population sample. Results We included 1721 autoimmune hepatitis patients. The incidence rate was 1.68 (95\% confidence interval 1.60 to 1.76) per 100,000 population per year, and it doubled during the study period. Of the 1318 patients who were biopsied at diagnosis, 28.3\% had cirrhosis. The 10-year cumulative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was 0.7\% (95\% confidence interval 0.3 to 1.5). Male gender and cirrhosis were associated with high mortality and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the first year after diagnosis, patients with autoimmune hepatitis had six-fold higher mortality than the general population; later, their mortality remained two-fold higher. Their 10-year cumulative mortality was 26.4\% (95\% confidence interval 23.7 to 29.1). 38.6\% of deaths were liver-related including 3.6\% from hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions This nationwide population-based study of autoimmune hepatitis showed that the incidence increased during 1994–2012, and that the disease remains associated with a high mortality, particularly in the first year after diagnosis. Male gender and cirrhosis were adverse prognostic factors.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) study is a national multicenter prospective follow-up study of 4,201 adults with type 1 diabetes from 21 university and central hospitals, 33 district hospitals, and 26 primary health care centers across Finland. RESULTS During a median 7 years of follow-up, there were 291 deaths (7\%), 3.6-fold (95\% CI 3.2–4.0) more than that observed in the age- and sex-matched general population. Excess mortality was only observed in individuals with chronic kidney disease. Individuals with normoalbuminuria showed no excess mortality beyond the general population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] 0.8, 95\% CI 0.5–1.1), independent of the duration of diabetes. The presence of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and end-stage kidney disease was associated with 2.8, 9.2, and 18.3 times higher SMR, respectively. The increase in mortality across each stage of albuminuria was equivalent to the risk conferred by preexisting macrovascular disease. In addition, the glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with mortality, such that individuals with impaired kidney function, as well as those demonstrating hyperfiltration, had an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS An independent graded association was observed between the presence and severity of kidney disease and mortality in a large contemporary cohort of individuals with type 1 diabetes. These findings highlight the clinical and public health importance of chronic kidney disease and its prevention in the management of type 1 diabetes.},

Main outcome measures Time to death from any cause out to 11 years after first AMI, identified from registry data, was the primary outcome measure. Cardiovascular drugs dispensed within 28 days following hospital discharge were identified as main exposure categories. Results In total, 975 deaths occurred during 1 year follow-up, culminating to 3247 by 11 years. 1-year risk of death was significantly reduced for all drug combinations, but not for drugs dispensed in isolation. Out to 11 years, only combinations of ‘β-blockers and statins’ (with or without ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB)) provided significant reductions in risk of all-cause mortality. In men, the greatest reduction in risk was associated with being dispensed ‘β-blockers and statins’ (HR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.36 to 0.58), whereas women benefited most from being dispensed ‘β-blockers, statins and ACEi/ARBs’ (HR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.99). Conclusions The combination of ‘β-blockers and statins’ (with or without ACEi/ARB) dispensed within 28 days postdischarge was associated with the greatest long-term survival following an AMI. Our observations of significantly reduced mortality risk in men (compared with women) who were dispensed ‘β-blockers and statins’, or ‘β-blockers and ACEi/ARBs’, warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {The effects and consequences of human behavior on mortality and life  expectancy have always been significant. Some of the recent significant trends in behavior have resulted in a significant and in some ways shocking increases in the prevalence of obesity in all sectors of the U.S. population (e.g., for all adults, the current reported obesity prevalence rate is 34.4 percent, based on a 2005-2006 nationally representative survey), as well as in almost all areas of the rest of the world. Since this increase has been gradual although relentless over the last 30 years, its existence has generally been accepted as a fact of life. Nevertheless, although this increase in weight and its general effect on the morbidity and mortality of those severely obese are uncontested, its overall effect on future mortality is still subject to debate and sometimes conflicting evidence.    The primary behavioral factors that have contributed to this trend involve the amount and mix of food intake and physical activity. Although it would be ideal if the specific short- and long-term effects of these factors could be identified, this is less useful than understanding the effect of these behavioral effects on a combined basis. In most cases, the level of obesity can serve as a reasonable surrogate for the combination of these factors.    This paper presents recent trends in obesity prevalence in significant population segments, including overall effects by age, gender and certain racial and ethnic groups, and discusses the ways in which obesity can influence mortality in each of these segments. It provides a synthesis of reported mortality experience relating to these behaviors by risk factors and diseases that will affect any mortality projection. Although usually measured in terms of Body Mass Index (BMI), alternative measures of adiposity, such as waist circumference, have shown that obesity, in one shape or another, can affect future mortality and morbidity levels.    These developments have significant implications for the individual and society as a whole. It is asserted that further data and analysis are needed, particularly in view of the long-term lags between the underlying behaviors and their mortality consequences. It also discusses the possible prevention and management of obesity. Although this paper focuses on the future obesity trends and their effect on mortality,},

  abstract = {The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) was developed to predict short-term mortality in patients with cirrhosis. It has since become the standard tool to prioritize patients for liver transplantation. We assessed the value of pretransplant MELD in the prediction of posttransplant survival. We identified adult patients who underwent liver transplantation at our institution during 1991–2002. Among 2,009 recipients, 1,472 met the inclusion criteria. Based on pretransplant MELD scores, recipients were stratified as low risk (≤15), medium risk (16–25), and high risk ({$>$}25). The primary endpoints were patient and graft survival. Mean posttransplant follow-up was 5.5 years. One-, 5- and 10-year patient survival was 83\%, 72\%, and 58\%, respectively, and graft survival was 76\%, 65\%, and 53\%, respectively. In univariable analysis, patient and donor age, patient sex, MELD score, disease etiology, and retransplantation were associated with posttransplantation patient and graft survival. In multivariable analysis adjusted for year of transplantation, patient age {$>$}65 years, donor age {$>$}50 years, male sex, and retransplantation and pretransplant MELD scores {$>$}25 were associated with poor patient and graft survival. The impact of MELD score {$>$}25 was maximal during the first year posttransplant. In conclusion, older patient and donor age, male sex of recipient, retransplantation, and high pretransplant MELD score are associated with poor posttransplant outcome.

  abstract = {BackgroundWe assessed the effect of T stage, Fuhrman’s grade, multifocality, bilaterality, positive surgical margins, and synchronism of bilateral tumors on cancer-specific survival of patients with nonmetastatic renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) undergoing nephron-sparing surgery for imperative indications.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 168 patients who underwent nephron-sparing surgery for imperative RCC indications between 1974 and 2002. A total of 85 patients had bilateral RCCs; in 27 patients, the tumors were multifocal. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to assess the features associated with cancer-specific survival.ResultsThe median follow-up was 99 months (range, 2–326 months). Patients were followed until January 2008. A total of 52 patients died of their cancer during follow-up. Multivariate analyses of the total group only revealed Fuhrman’s grade 3 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.94) and bilateral occurrence of RCC (HR 1.82) as independent prognostic factors. In a subgroup analysis of patients with bilateral occurrence of RCC, we observed a tendency toward positive surgical margins (HR 2.89, P = 0.08) being another negative prognostic factor. There was no difference in cancer-specific survival between patients with synchronous and metachronous bilateral RCC presence (HR 1.08).ConclusionsFuhrman’s grade 3 and bilateral occurrence of RCC were the only statistically significant prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival in patients undergoing nephron-sparing surgery for imperative indications for nonmetastatic RCC. The presence of sporadic multifocal tumors and the synchronous occurrence of bilateral tumors have no influence on cancer-specific survival, while positive surgical margins may have an impact in the subset of patients with bilateral RCC.},

  abstract = {Background and aims: A new score for the histological severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), called SAF (Steatosis, Activity and Fibrosis) has been developed. We aimed to evaluate the impact of this score on overall mortality.Methods: We used data from 139 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. All biopsies were graded according to the SAF scoring system and disease severity was classified as mild, moderate or severe. Causes of death were extracted from a national, population-based register. A Cox regression model, adjusted for sex, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes mellitus type 2, was applied.Results: At baseline 35 patients presented with mild or moderate disease respectively, and 69 patients with severe disease. During follow-up (median 25.3 years, range 1.7–40.8) 74 patients died, 11 in the mild group (31\%), 18 in the moderate group (51\%) and 45 in the severe group (65\%), p = .002. Compared to patients with mild disease, patients with moderate disease did not have a significant increase in overall mortality (HR 1.83, 95\%CI 0.89–3.77, p = .10). Patients with severe disease had a significant increase in mortality (HR 2.65, 95\%CI 1.19–5.93, p = .017). However, when adjusting for fibrosis stage, significance was lost (HR 1.85, 95\%CI 0.76–4.54, p = .18). NASH, defined as per the FLIP algorithm, was not associated with mortality compared to not having NASH (HR 1.46, 95\%CI 0.74–2.90, p = .28).Conclusions: After adjustment for fibrosis, the SAF score was not associated with increased mortality in NAFLD. This finding should be corroborated in larger cohorts with similar follow-up time.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Fushimi AF Registry is a community-based prospective survey of AF patients who visited the participating medical institutions in Fushmi-ku, Japan. The BW and follow-up data were available for 2,945 patients. We compared the background and the incidence of clinical events during a median follow-up of 746 days between a LBW and non-LBW group. Patients in the LBW group accounted for 26.8\% (788 patients) of the total. The LBW group was more often female, older, and had higher CHADS2score. The incidence of stroke/systemic embolism (SE) during follow-up was higher in the LBW group (hazard ratio (HR): 2.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.57-3.04; P{$<$}0.01), whereas that of major bleeding was comparable (HR: 1.05, 95\% CI: 0.64-1.68; P=0.84). This trend was consistently observed in the subgroups stratified by age, sex, and oral anticoagulant prescription at baseline. Multivariate analysis as well as propensity-score matching analysis further supported the significance of LBW as a risk of stroke/SE. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the LBW group had high risk profiles and showed a higher incidence of stroke/SE, but the incidence of major bleeding was not particularly high.},

The health benefits of this type of activity pattern remain unclear. PURPOSE: To examine dose-response associations between physical activity and survival using time-varying analysis to understand the importance of "non-exercise" activity for survival in older adults. METHODS: Participants (N=10,426) were drawn from The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a representative sample of men and women aged ≥50 years living in England. Participant data were linked with death records from the National Health Service registries from 2002 to 2011. Analyses were conducted in 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of death according to time-varying estimates of physical activity. RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 7.8 years (median follow-up, 8.5 years), there were 1,896 deaths. In models adjusted for comorbidities, psychosocial factors, smoking, and obesity, there was a dose-response association between time-varying physical activity and mortality, with the greatest survival benefit in vigorously active participants. However, participating in mild ("non-exercise")-intensity physical activity was also associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.76, 95\% CI=0.69, 0.83); cardiovascular mortality (HR=0.74, 95\% CI=0.64, 0.85); and death by other causes (HR=0.67, 95\% CI=0.58, 0.78). Time-varying models produced stronger, more robust estimates than models using a single measurement of physical activity at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults gain health benefits from participating in regular "non-exercise" physical activity, although the greatest benefits are observed for more vigorous activity.},

Kaplan–Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regressions were applied for survival rates. Results: Among 238 patients, 151 (63.4\%) smoked and 146 (61.3\%) drank alcohol.

Patients with a lifetime cigarette smoking of {$<$}40 and ≥40 pack-years had increased cancer recurrence or death from any cause (aHR, 1.72 and 2.43, respectively; 95\% CI, 1.03–2.86 and 1.38–4.30, respectively), cancer recurrence (aHR, 1.63 and 2.61, respectively; 95\% CI, 0.95–2.79 and 1.43–4.77, respectively), and overall mortality (aHR, 1.92 and 2.75, respectively; 95\% CI, 1.09–3.38 and 1.47–5.12, respectively) compared with never-smokers. However, drinking alcohol was not associated with postsurgery survival. Conclusions: Cigarette-smoking history at the time of diagnosis, but not drinking history, is associated with cancer recurrence and poor survival after surgery in male patients with stage III–IV gastric cancer. Impact: These findings encourage physicians to advise patients with gastric cancer to stop smoking to obtain a general health benefit and likely improvement in the gastric cancer course.

Methods The Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to September 2010. Search criteria included observational studies containing patients with isolated PMR reporting on a vascular outcome. Data were extracted and articles were assessed for quality. Results The database search identified 545 articles. Eight articles reporting on 7 unique studies were included in the final review. Four studies reported on vascular mortality and 3 studies reported on other vascular outcomes. Four of the studies reported statistically significant positive associations between PMR and vascular disease and 3 studies reported no statistically significant results. The heterogeneity of the results was investigated; the strongest explanatory variable was that 2 of 3 studies that reported nonsignificant results were prospective, whereas all of those studies reporting significant results were retrospective. Conclusion There is some evidence to suggest that, like other inflammatory rheumatic disorders, PMR may be linked to an increased risk of vascular disease. Further studies are required to quantify the level of risk to determine whether patients with PMR should be actively screened for cardiovascular disease and its risk factors.},

Other inflammatory rheumatologic disorders are associated with an excess risk of vascular disease. We investigated whether polymyalgia rheumatica is associated with an increased risk of vascular events. Methods: We used the General Practice Research Database to identify patients with a diagnosis of incident polymyalgia rheumatica between Jan. 1, 1987, and Dec. 31, 1999. Patients were matched by age, sex and practice with up to 5 patients without polymyalgia rheumatica. Patients were followed until their first vascular event (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular) or the end of available records (May 2011). All participants were free of vascular disease before the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (or matched date). We used Cox regression models to compare time to first vascular event in patients with and without polymyalgia rheumatica. Results: A total of 3249 patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and 12 735 patients without were included in the final sample. Over a median follow-up period of 7.8 (interquartile range 3.3–12.4) years, the rate of vascular events was higher among patients with polymyalgia rheumatica than among those without (36.1 v. 12.2 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio 2.6, 95\% confidence interval 2.4–2.9). The increased risk of a vascular event was similar for each vascular disease end point. The magnitude of risk was higher in early disease and in patients younger than 60 years at diagnosis. Interpretation: Patients with polymyalgia rheumatica have an increased risk of vascular events. This risk is greatest in the youngest age groups. As with other forms of inflammatory arthritis, patients with polymyalgia rheumatica should have their vascular risk factors identified and actively managed to reduce this excess risk.},

In 521 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I EEC were included. The baseline patient characteristics were analyzed with the chi-square test and Fisher's exact tests. A multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazard model and logistic regression were performed to identify the prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) in FIGO stage I EEC., The median follow-up period for the included patients was 74.6 months (3.1–264.9 months). Tumor recurrence occurred in 30 patients (5.8\%) with a median time span of 22.85 months (2.2–124.7 months). Only 2 factors among the conventional adverse risk factors, including myometrial invasion and histologic grade, affected tumor recurrence in stage I EEC (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.003 and P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.003, respectively). Myometrial invasion was an independent prognostic factor for RFS in stage IA EEC via multivariate analysis (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.005). In stage IB EEC, the histologic grade was an independent prognostic factor for RFS.

The aim of this study was to estimate mortality in patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive (AChR-Ab-seropositive) MG in a nationwide population-based, long-term follow-up study. METHODS: All AChR-Ab-seropositive MG patients, diagnosed between 1985 and 2005, were identified. Defined by age at diagnosis (≤ 50 or {$>$}50 years), patients were classified as having early- or late-onset MG. For comparison, 10 non-MG individuals from the general population were matched with each patient. All patients and controls were followed until January 1, 2009. Mortality rates and estimated mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were calculated. RESULTS: Of 702 AChR-Ab-seropositive MG patients, 302 died during follow-up. Overall mortality was higher for patients with MG (MRR\,= 1.41, range 1.24-1.60). In late-onset women and men, the MRRs were 1.64 (1.36-1.99) and 1.22 (1.02-1.46), respectively. Total MRR was highest during the first 5 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: MG diagnosis is still associated with increased mortality.},

Therefore, we conducted this prospective study of a random sample of 1700 Danish men and women, aged 41 to 72 years, without major cardiovascular diseases. At baseline, ambulatory blood pressure, office blood pressure, and other risk factors were recorded. After a mean period of 9.5 years, 174 had died: 63 were cardiovascular deaths. In multivariate proportional hazards models, adjusted for other risk factors of significance, the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality (95\% confidence interval) associated with 10 mm Hg increments in systolic and 5 mm Hg increments in diastolic ambulatory blood pressure were 1.51 (1.28 to 1.77) and 1.43 (1.26 to 1.61). The corresponding figures for all cause mortality were 1.18 (1.06 to 1.31) and 1.18 (1.09 to 1.28). The relative risks of cardiovascular mortality were lower for office blood pressure, and office blood pressure did not predict all cause mortality. When ambulatory and office blood pressures were entered in the same multivariate models, only the ambulatory blood pressures were significant predictors of all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. The relationship between ambulatory blood pressures and risk of mortality was log-linear, with no indication of a threshold. The absolute risk of mortality was also dependent on age and smoking status, and an upper “acceptable” ambulatory blood pressure based on risk of mortality could only be defined when other risk factors were taken into account. In conclusion, ambulatory blood pressure provided prognostic information on mortality above and beyond that of office blood pressure.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze changes by age-group in all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates from 2000-2011 in people with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,189,079 (7.3\% with type 1 diabetes) Australians with diabetes registered on the National Diabetes Service Scheme between 2000 and 2011 were linked to the National Death Index. Mortality rates in the total population were age standardized to the 2001 Australian population. Mortality rates were calculated for the following age-groups: 0 to {$<$}40 years, ≥ 40 to {$<$}60 years, and ≥60 to ≤85 years. Annual mortality rates were fitted using a Poisson regression model including calendar year as a covariate and age and sex where appropriate, with Ptrend reported. RESULTS: For type 1 diabetes, all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) decreased each year by 0.61, 0.35, and 0.14 per 1,000 person-years (PY), respectively, between 2000 and 2011, Ptrend {$<$} 0.05, while cancer mortality remained unchanged. By age, significant decreases in all-cause, CVD, and diabetes mortality rates were observed in all age-groups, excluding diabetes mortality in age-group 0-40 years. For type 2 diabetes, all-cause, CVD, and diabetes ASMRs decreased per year by 0.18, 0.15, and 0.03 per 1,000 PY, respectively, Ptrend {$<$} 0.001, while cancer remained unchanged. By age, these decreases were observed in all age-groups, excluding 0-40 years, where significant increases in all-cause and cancer mortality were noted and no change was seen for CVD and diabetes mortality. CONCLUSIONS: All-cause, CVD, and diabetes ASMRs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes decreased between 2000 and 2011, while cancer ASMRs remained unchanged. However, younger populations are not benefiting from the same improvements as older populations. In addition, the absence of a decline in cancer mortality warrants urgent attention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND There is a large body of research on adulthood risk factors for retirement due to disability, but studies on the effect of adverse childhood experiences are scarce. AIM To examine whether adverse childhood experiences predict disability retirement. METHODS Data were derived from the Health and Social Support Study. The information was gathered from postal surveys in 1998 (baseline) and in 2003 (follow-up questionnaire). The analysed data consisted of 8817 non-retired respondents aged 40-54 years (5149 women, 3668 men). Negative childhood experiences, such as financial difficulties, serious conflicts and alcohol-related problems, were assessed at baseline and disability retirement at follow-up. RESULTS The risk of disability retirement increased in a dose-response manner with increasing number of childhood adversities. Respondents who had experienced multiple childhood adversities had a 3.46-fold increased risk (95\% CI 2.09 to 5.71) of disability retirement compared with those who reported no such adversities. Low socioeconomic status, depression (Beck Depression Inventory-21), use of drugs for somatic diseases as well as health-related risk behaviour, such as smoking, heavy alcohol consumption and obesity, were also predictors of disability retirement. After simultaneous adjustments for all these risk factors, the association between childhood adversities and the risk of disability retirement attenuated, but remained significant (OR 1.90, 95\% CI 1.07 to 3.37). CONCLUSIONS Information on childhood conditions may increase our understanding of the determinants of early retirement, especially due to mental disorders. Childhood adversities should be taken into account when considering determinants of disability retirement and identifying groups at risk.},

Both for white and for black adult females, there were significant secular increases in the proportion of adult females in each of the successively heavier categories of body mass index. These increases were identical for white and for black adult females on the log-odds scale, but black adult females were already significantly heavier at the first survey.

  abstract = {Background: Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects gait and postural stability, resulting in an increased risk of falling. The purpose of this study was to estimate mortality associated with demographic factors after hip or pelvic (hip/pelvic) fracture in people with Parkinson disease. A secondary goal was to compare the mortality associated with Parkinson disease to that associated with other common medical conditions in patients with hip/pelvic fracture. Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study of 1,980,401 elderly Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with hip/pelvic fracture from 2000 to 2005 who were identified with use of the Beneficiary Annual Summary File. The race/ethnicity distribution of the sample was white (93.2\%), black (3.8\%), Hispanic (1.2\%), and Asian (0.6\%). Individuals with Parkinson disease (131,215) were identified with use of outpatient and carrier claims. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of death associated with demographic and clinical variables and to compare mortality after hip/pelvic fracture between patients with Parkinson disease and those with other medical conditions associated with high mortality after hip/pelvic fracture, after adjustment for race/ethnicity, sex, age, and modified Charlson comorbidity score. Results: Among those with Parkinson disease, women had lower mortality after hip/pelvic fracture than men (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63, 95\% confidence interval [CI]) = 0.62 to 0.64), after adjustment for covariates. Compared with whites, blacks had a higher (HR = 1.12, 95\% CI = 1.09 to 1.16) and Hispanics had a lower (HR = 0.87, 95\% CI = 0.81 to 0.95) mortality, after adjustment for covariates. Overall, the adjusted mortality rate after hip/pelvic fracture in individuals with Parkinson disease (HR = 2.41, 95\% CI = 2.37 to 2.46) was substantially elevated compared with those without the disease, a finding similar to the increased mortality associated with a diagnosis of dementia (HR = 2.73, 95\% CI = 2.68 to 2.79), kidney disease (HR = 2.66, 95\% CI = 2.60 to 2.72), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR = 2.48, 95\% CI = 2.43 to 2.53). Conclusions: Mortality after hip/pelvic fracture in Parkinson disease varies according to demographic factors. Mortality after hip/pelvic fracture is substantially increased among those with Parkinson disease. Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level III.

  abstract = {1. Key findings This report uses data from the Health and Lifestyles in the North West 2007 report and explores the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and a number of self-reported lifestyle characteristics and lifestyle-related illnesses. BMI is a measure of weight in relation to height and the categories included here are underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese. Being either underweight or overweight can have a significant impact upon health; in particular, obesity increases morbidity and mortality and places a significant burden on the health service. Consequently, encouraging people to maintain a healthy weight should continue to be a priority. Throughout the report, geodemographic classification systems are used to illustrate any relationships between BMI categories and deprivation. Data on BMI were also explored in relation to gender and age. This section of the report summarises the key findings. • 2.7\% of respondents were underweight, 49.0\% were normal weight, 34.1\% were overweight and 14.2\% were obese. • Women were significantly more likely than men to be underweight or normal weight, and were significantly less likely than men to be overweight or obese. • Generally, BMI increased as people aged but decreased as they reached their late 60s. • There was no association between underweight and deprivation. • For men, there was no association between normal weight and deprivation. For women, five of the six geodemographic classification systems showed a relationship between normal weight and deprivation, with increasing levels of deprivation being associated with a lower proportion of normal weight women. • As deprivation increased, the proportion of obese people increased and this relationship was evident among both men and women. • Maintaining a normal weight was significantly associated with participating in moderate or high levels of physical activity. • In general, the more time a person spends being sedentary, the greater their weight. • While a healthy diet is known to confer benefits, logistic regression analyses showed that the number of portions of fruit and vegetables eaten per day was not significantly associated with a person’s weight. • Smoking and alcohol consumption were both related to BMI. • People who were normal weight were more likely than other respondents to rate their own health as very good. • Having recently experienced a stroke, a heart attack or having angina were not significantly associated with BMI category. • Having arthritis was more common among those who were obese. • Nervous trouble or depression was associated with being underweight and being obese. • Back problems were more likely among those who were overweight and obese. • Diabetes was positively associated with being obese. • High blood pressure was more common among those who were overweight and obese, with highest levels being among those who were obese.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered a growing health threat in the United States. Although physicians have an important role in counseling their patients for obesity prevention and treatment, physicians themselves are often overweight. There are few data regarding how physician body weight might affect patient receptiveness to obesity counseling. METHODS: A 43-item survey instrument was developed that consisted of three scales related to physician characteristics, health locus of control, and perceptions on receiving health advice from overweight physicians. The survey was administered to 226 patients in five physician offices. Two of the physicians were classified as obese using BMI calculations, and three were nonobese. The responses from the surveys were grouped into those from obese and nonobese physicians. RESULTS: Significant differences were found for patient receptiveness to counseling for treatment of illness (P = 0.038) and health advice (P = 0.049), with the patients of nonobese physicians indicating greater confidence scores. The difference for weight and fitness counseling did not reach significance (P = 0.075). Analysis revealed that patient BMI was not a significant covariate nor were items related to physician characteristics in general or health locus of control. CONCLUSIONS: Patients seeking care from nonobese physicians indicated greater confidence in general health counseling and treatment of illness than patients seeing obese physicians. It is not known if this can be translated into increased success in obesity prevention and treatment},

We investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality dynamics in relation to baseline DM, statin use and metformin use. The study population consisted of 39,900 incident cancer cases from Finland, 19,822 patients were free of DM at the start of follow-up and 20,078 had DM. Mortality from all causes, and cancer, cardiovascular (CVD) and other causes was analysed using Poisson regression model with the following variables: sex, age, DM, statin and metformin usage in baseline, cancer type and stage and calendar period. Statin usage was associated with a reduced cancer-specific mortality with incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.72 (95\% confidence interval 0.69–0.74), IRR for CVD mortality was 0.95 (0.88–1.02) and for other causes 0.64 (0.56–0.74). In a sub-population of DM patients, IRR for metformin in all-cause mortality was 0.74 (0.71–0.78), in cancer mortality 0.75 (0.72–0.79), in CVD mortality 0.75 (0.68–0.83) and other causes 0.68 (0.60–0.78). In conclusion, our register-based study of survival after cancer diagnosis showed that patients with diabetes had substantially poorer outcome in all measures. An association between baseline statin usage and lower all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular mortality was modified by cancer type. The effect of statin use was largest for breast and colorectal cancer. Metformin usage in a subpopulation of oral antidiabetic users was in general associated with lower mortality, but this association was modified by cancer type. The association was strongest for liver, colorectal and breast cancer.},

Design Systematic review. Data sources Medline, Embase, reference lists and grey literature were searched; studies known to experts were also retrieved. Main outcome measures All cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease and stroke. Review methods Longitudinal studies in which participants were representative of the general population (all ages, either sex) and which used any standard method for measurement and calculation of the ABI. Studies in which participants were selected according to presence of pre-existing disease or were post intervention (e.g. angioplasty or peripheral arterial grafting) were excluded. Results 11 studies comprising 44,590 subjects from six different countries were included. Despite clinical heterogeneity between studies, the findings were remarkably consistent in demonstrating an increased risk of clinical cardiovascular disease associated with a low ABI. A low ABI ({$<$}0.9) was associated with an increased risk of subsequent all cause mortality (pooled RR 1.60, 95\% CI 1.32–1.95), cardiovascular mortality (pooled RR 1.96, 95\% CI 1.46–2.64), coronary heart disease (pooled RR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.08–1.93) and stroke (pooled RR 1.35, 95\% CI 1.10–1.65) after adjustment for age, sex, conventional cardiovascular risk factors and prevalent cardiovascular disease. Conclusions The ABI may help to identify asymptomatic individuals in the general population who are at increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Evaluation is now required of the potential of incorporating ABI measurement into cardiovascular prevention programmes.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Atrial fibrillation is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but scant data are available for long-term outcomes in individuals outside North America or Europe, especially in primary care settings. Methods We did a cohort study using a prospective registry of patients in 47 countries who presented to a hospital emergency department with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as a primary or secondary diagnosis. 15\hphantom{,}400 individuals were enrolled to determine the occurrence of death and strokes (the primary outcomes) in this cohort over eight geographical regions (North America, western Europe, and Australia; South America; eastern Europe; the Middle East and Mediterranean crescent; sub-Saharan Africa; India; China; and southeast Asia) 1 year after attending the emergency department. Patients from North America, western Europe, and Australia were used as the reference population, and compared with patients from the other seven regions Findings Between Dec 24, 2007, and Oct 21, 2011, we enrolled 15\hphantom{,}400 individuals to the registry. Follow-up was complete for 15\hphantom{,}361 (99·7\%), of whom 1758 (11\%) died within 1 year. Fewer deaths occurred among patients presenting to the emergency department with a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation compared with patients who had atrial fibrillation as a secondary diagnosis (377 [6\%] of 6825 patients vs 1381 [16\%] of 8536, p{$<$}0·0001). Twice as many patients had died by 1 year in South America (192 [17\%] of 1132) and Africa (225 [20\%] of 1137) compared with North America, western Europe, and Australia (366 [10\%] of 3800, p{$<$}0·0001). Heart failure was the most common cause of death (519 [30\%] of 1758); stroke caused 148 (8\%) deaths. 604 (4\%) of 15361 patients had had a stroke by 1 year; 170 (3\%) of 6825 for whom atrial fibrillation was a primary diagnosis and 434 (5\%) of 8536 for whom it was a secondary diagnosis (p{$<$}0·0001). The highest number of strokes occurred in patients in Africa (89 [8\%] of 1137), China (143 [7\%] of 2023), and southeast Asia (88 [7\%] of 1331) and the lowest occurred in India (20 [{$<$}1\%] of 2536). 94 (3\%) of 3800 patients in North America, western Europe, and Australia had a stroke. Interpretation Marked unexplained inter-regional variations in the occurrence of stroke and mortality suggest that factors other than clinical variables might be important. Prevention of death from heart failure should be a major priority in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Funding Boehringer Ingelheim.},

  abstract = {Background The International Metastatic Renal-Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium model offers prognostic information for patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. We tested the accuracy of the model in an external population and compared it with other prognostic models. Methods We included patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma who were treated with first-line VEGF-targeted treatment at 13 international cancer centres and who were registered in the Consortium’s database but had not contributed to the initial development of the Consortium Database model. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We compared the Database Consortium model with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) model, the International Kidney Cancer Working Group (IKCWG) model, the French model, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) model by concordance indices and other measures of model fit. Findings Overall, 1028 patients were included in this study, of whom 849 had complete data to assess the Database Consortium model. Median overall survival was 18·8 months (95\% 17·6–21·4). The predefined Database Consortium risk factors (anaemia, thrombocytosis, neutrophilia, hypercalcaemia, Karnofsky performance status {$<$}80\%, and {$<$}1 year from diagnosis to treatment) were independent predictors of poor overall survival in the external validation set (hazard ratios ranged between 1·27 and 2·08, concordance index 0·71, 95\% CI 0·68–0·73). When patients were segregated into three risk categories, median overall survival was 43·2 months (95\% CI 31·4–50·1) in the favourable risk group (no risk factors; 157 patients), 22·5 months (18·7–25·1) in the intermediate risk group (one to two risk factors; 440 patients), and 7·8 months (6·5–9·7) in the poor risk group (three or more risk factors; 252 patients; p{$<$}0·0001; concordance index 0·664, 95\% CI 0·639–0·689). 672 patients had complete data to test all five models. The concordance index of the CCF model was 0·662 (95\% CI 0·636–0·687), of the French model 0·640 (0·614–0·665), of the IKCWG model 0·668 (0·645–0·692), and of the MSKCC model 0·657 (0·632–0·682). The reported versus predicted number of deaths at 2 years was most similar in the Database Consortium model compared with the other models. Interpretation The Database Consortium model is now externally validated and can be applied to stratify patients by risk in clinical trials and to counsel patients about prognosis.},

  abstract = {Background.~Prognostic indices that estimate long-term mortality are essential not only to compare different clinical studies and populations but also to perform the most appropriate therapeutic interventions. All-cause mortality is high after renal transplantation (RTx), but no prognostic index has focused on predicting mortality in RTx. We developed and tested a prognostic index for mortality in RTx after hospitalization.         Methods.~We retrospectively analyzed survival in 1,293 RTx recipients who were randomly assigned to two groups: a modeling population (n=646), used to create the new index, and a testing population (n=647), used to test this index. Patients were stratified into three risk groups (low, medium, and high) by combining peritransplant risk factors for mortality (β-coefficient), using a simple eight-point check list: age, pretransplant cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction at discharge, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular calcification, diabetes, time on dialysis, and acute tubular necrosis.         Results.~Overall lower survival rates were observed with increasing risk classes in the testing population (log-rank test=18; P=0.0001). The 8-year survival rates ranged from 94\% in the lowest-risk group to 59\% in the highest-risk group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.63. Mortality risk (Cox analysis) significantly increased with increasing risk classes (medium risk: relative risk=3.8, 95\% confidence interval=1.5–9.5, P=0.004; high risk: relative risk=6.3, 95\% confidence interval=2.4–16.2, P=0.0001).         Conclusions.~This simple prognostic index applicable at the bedside may accurately predict survival in RTx recipients after discharge. Consequently, targeted treatment interventions may be indicated for minimizing mortality, especially in high-risk groups.},

  abstract = {Although the association between alcohol and pancreatic diseases has been recognized for a long time, the impact of alcohol consumption on pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (PC) remains poorly defined. Nowadays there is not consensus about the epidemiology and the beverage type, dose and duration of alcohol consumption causing these diseases. The objective of this study was to review the epidemiology described in the literature for pancreatic diseases as a consequence of alcoholic behavior trying to understand the association between dose, type and frequency of alcohol consumption and risk of pancreatitis and PC. The majority of the studies conclude that high alcohol intake was associated with a higher risk of pancreatitis (around 2.5\%-3\% between heavy drinkers and 1.3\% between non drinkers). About 70\% of pancreatitis are due to chronic heavy alcohol consumption. Although this incidence rate differs between countries, it is clear that the risk of developing pancreatitis increases with increasing doses of alcohol and the average of alcohol consumption vary since 80 to 150 g/d for 10-15 years. With regard to PC, the role of alcohol consumption remains less clear, and low to moderate alcohol consumption do not appear to be associated with PC risk, and only chronic heavy drinking increase the risk compared with lightly drinkers. In a population of 10\%-15\% of heavy drinkers, 2\%-5\% of all PC cases could be attributed to alcohol consumption. However, as only a minority (less than 10\% for pancreatitis and 5\% for PC) of heavily drinkers develops these pancreatic diseases, there are other predisposing factors besides alcohol involved. Genetic variability and environmental exposures such as smoking and diet modify the risk and should be considered for further investigations.},

No studies have evaluated prospectively collected information on ischaemia and its effect on short- and long-term coronary mortality. The objective of this study was to compare patients with and without prospectively measured ischaemic presentations before AMI in terms of infarct characteristics and coronary mortality.Methods and resultsAs part of the CALIBER programme, we linked data from primary care, hospital admissions, the national acute coronary syndrome registry and cause-specific mortality to identify patients with first AMI (n = 16,439). We analysed time from AMI to coronary mortality (n = 5283 deaths) using Cox regression (median 2.6 years follow-up), comparing patients with and without recent ischaemic presentations. Patients with ischaemic presentations in the 90 days before AMI experienced lower coronary mortality in the first 7 days after AMI compared with those with no prior ischaemic presentations, after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, blood pressure and cardiovascular medications [HR: 0.64 (95\% CI: 0.57–0.73) P \&lt; 0.001], but subsequent mortality was higher [HR: 1.42 (1.13–1.77) P = 0.001]. Patients with ischaemic presentations closer in time to AMI had the lowest seven day mortality (P-trend = 0.001).ConclusionIn the first large prospective study of ischaemic presentations prior to AMI, we have shown that those occurring closest to AMI are associated with lower short-term coronary mortality following AMI, which could represent a natural ischaemic preconditioning effect, observed in a clinical setting.Clinical trials registrationClinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01604486.},

METHODS A systematic literature review was performed by searching PubMed and Embase for publications using GPRD data published between 1987 and April 2008. Additional publications were identified from conference proceedings, back issues of relevant journals, bibliographies of retrieved publications and relevant websites. Publications that reported attempts to validate disease diagnoses recorded in the GPRD were included. RESULTS We identified 212 publications, often validating more than one diagnosis. In total, 357 validations investigating 183 different diagnoses met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 303 (85\%) utilized data from outside the GPRD to validate diagnoses. The remainder utilized only data recorded in the database. The median proportion of cases with a confirmed diagnosis was 89\% (range 24–100\%). Details of validation methods and results were often incomplete. CONCLUSIONS A number of methods have been used to assess validity. Overall, estimates of validity were high. However, the quality of reporting of the validations was often inadequate to permit a clear interpretation. Not all methods provided a quantitative estimate of validity and most methods considered only the positive predictive value of a set of diagnostic codes in a highly selected group of cases.

The present study aims to examine the effect of anxiety and depression on 5-year mortality in patients referred for exercise testing. Methods: A total of 5057 patients referred for routine exercise testing completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before undergoing the exercise test. Survival data were obtained from 5017 (99.2\%) of those patients after 5.7 ± 0.8 years. HADS scores and cardiological baseline data were used to predict mortality. Results: In univariate analyses, HADS depression was not a significant predictor; high anxiety was associated with improved survival. Logistic regression revealed nine independent objective predictors from which we computed a composite somatic risk index. When controlling for this physical risk index, anxiety and depression had independent, opposite effects; that is, anxiety was associated with a lower mortality and depression with a higher mortality. Conclusion: Anxiety and depression scores have different predictive effects on mortality in patients referred for exercise testing. These effects are independent of a highly effective physical risk index, suggesting that psychological screening of cardiology patients might improve risk stratification.},

Specimens were graded blindly with regard to HER-2/neu staining intensity. Overexpression of HER-2/neu was identified as strong in 37 patients (15\%), mild in 144 (58\%), and none in 66 (27\%). The 5-year progression-free survival was 56\% for the strong, 83\% for the mild, and 95\% for the nonstaining groups. The strong (P {$<$} 0.0001) and the mild (P = 0.028) staining groups were distinct from the nonstaining group in predicting progression-free survival. Likewise, strong overexpression was associated with a poor (51\%) overall survival (P {$<$} 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that intense overexpression had independent significance in predicting progression-free (P = 0.0003) and overall survival (P {$<$} 0.0001). In stage I patients (203), the 5-year progression-free survival was 62\% for the strong and 97\% for the nonstaining groups (P = 0.0007). This retained independent significance when subjected to multivariate analysis (P = 0.0017). Other significant stage I prognostic factors in multivariate analysis included DNA ploidy, histologic subtype, and histologic grade but not depth of invasion.},

Methods: A total of 14 458 people aged 75 years and over participating in a trial of health screening of older people in general practice answered questions on three respiratory symptoms: cough, sputum production, and wheeze. The association of symptoms with mortality was examined for all cause and respiratory causes of death taking account of potential confounders. Results: Coughing up phlegm in winter mornings had a prevalence of 27.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 26.8 to 27.2). Those with this symptom had an adjusted hazard ratio for all cause mortality of 1.35 (95\% CI 1.21 to 1.50), p{$<$}0.001 and for respiratory specific mortality of 2.01 (95\% CI 1.66 to 2.41), p{$<$}0.001. Phlegm at any time of the day in winter had a prevalence of 16.5\% (95\% CI 16.3 to 16.7) with hazard ratios for all cause and respiratory specific mortality of 1.28 (95\% CI 1.15 to 1.42) and 2.28 (95\% CI 1.92 to 2.70), p{$<$}0.001. Wheeze or whistling from the chest had a prevalence of 14.3\% (95\% CI 14.1 to 14.5) with hazard ratios of 1.45 (95\% CI 1.31 to 1.61) and 2.86 (95\% CI 2.45 to 3.35), p{$<$}0.001. Conclusions: The prevalence of respiratory symptoms is widespread among elderly people and their presence is a strong predictor of mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body weight scales to height with a power of ≈2, thus forming the basis of body mass index (weight/height(2)). The corresponding scaling of body composition to height has not been established in a representative sample of US adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the scaling of weight, fat, fat-free mass, and bone mineral content to height. DESIGN: Adult non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), and Mexican American National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants were included in allometric analyses if they had complete age, weight, height, and body-composition data as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Powers of height in allometric regression models were developed for each measure and adjusted for age. RESULTS: The analyses included 13,183 subjects (6699 NHW, 3015 NHB, and 3469 Mexican American). The scaling of weight to height across sex-race groups provided powers (mean ± SE) ranging from 1.85 ± 0.12 in Mexican American women to 2.48 ± 0.17 in Mexican American men. Powers of height for body composition similarly ranged widely and were often outside the 95\% CI for a power of 2. Of the 3 body-composition measures, the mean age-adjusted powers of height rounded to 2 as the nearest integer in 16 of 18 sex-race groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adult weight and body composition scale to height with variable age-adjusted powers that are sometimes outside the 95\% CI for a power of 2 but frequently round to 2 as the nearest integer. These observations have implications for developing height-adjusted body-composition indexes.},

We randomized 135 patients who met the criteria for severe AH into the following groups: 35 patients received prednisone (PDN) 40 mg/d, 35 patients received PDN+MTD 500 mg three times daily, 33 patients received pentoxifylline (PTX) 400 mg three times daily, and 32 patients received PTX+MTD 500 mg three times daily. The duration of the treatment for all of the groups was 30 d., RESULTS: In the groups treated with the MTD, the survival rate was higher at 3 mo (PTX+MTD 59.4\% vs PTX 33.3\%, P = 0.04; PDN+MTD 68.6\% vs PDN 20\%, P = 0.0001) and at 6 mo (PTX+MTD 50\% vs PTX 18.2\%, P = 0.01; PDN+MTD 48.6\% vs PDN 20\%, P = 0.003) than in the groups not treated with MTD. A relapse in alcohol intake was the primary independent factor predicting mortality at 6 mo. The patients receiving MTD maintained greater abstinence than those who did not receive it (74.5\% vs 59.4\%, P = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: MTD improves the 3- and 6-mo survival rates in patients with severe AH. Alcohol abstinence is a key factor for survival in these patients. The patients who received the combination therapy with MTD were more likely to maintain abstinence than those who received monotherapy with either PDN or PTX.},

Methods The present study included 730 consecutive patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who underwent radical cystectomy. Clinicopathological outcomes in these patients were analyzed focusing on the impact of performance status, which was assessed using the Karnofsky Performance Status scale before surgery. Patients were classified into groups with Karnofsky Performance Status ≥90 and ≤80. Results A total of 561 (76.8\%) and 169 (23.2\%) patients were judged to have Karnofsky Performance Status ≥90 and ≤80, respectively. During a mean of 52.0 months, disease recurrence and mortality occurred in 257 (35.2\%) and 249 (34.1\%) patients, respectively, and the 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were 64.1 and 65.3\%, respectively. There were significant differences in age, hemoglobin, albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, pathological T stage and nodal involvement between the Karnofsky Performance Status ≥90 and ≤80 groups. Multivariate analysis showed independent impacts of Karnofsky Performance Status, pathological T stage, nodal involvement and lymphovascular invasion on recurrence-free survival, as well as independent impacts of Karnofsky Performance Status, age, body mass index, hemoglobin, pathological T stage, nodal involvement and lymphovascular invasion on overall survival.

  abstract = {Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital admission. Design Prospective open cohort study. Participants Routinely collected data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the validation cohort. Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group. The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify patients into frailty groups. Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all cause mortality. Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure, corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability, leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson’s disease, poor mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result, high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss, unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation explained 55.6\% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good discrimination—the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell’s C statistic value was 0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1\%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7\% of patients (n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4\% (n=46 770) as moderately frail, 43.1\% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8\% (n=223 790) as fit. Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social, and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment or interventions.},

Setting General practices in England providing data for the QResearch database linked to the national cancer registry. Participants 44 145 patients aged 15-99 with colorectal cancer from 947 practices to derive the equations. The equations were validated in 15 214 patients with colorectal cancer from 305 different QResearch practices and 437 821 patients with colorectal cancer from the national cancer registry. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was all cause mortality and secondary outcome was colorectal cancer mortality. Methods Cause specific hazards models were used to predict risks of colorectal cancer mortality and other cause mortality accounting for competing risks, and these risk estimates were combined to obtain risks of all cause mortality. Separate equations were derived for men and women. Several variables were tested: age, ethnicity, deprivation score, cancer stage, cancer grade, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index, family history of bowel cancer, anaemia, liver function test result, comorbidities, use of statins, use of aspirin, clinical values for anaemia, and platelet count. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in both validation cohorts at 1, 5, and 10 years. Results The final models included the following variables in men and women: age, deprivation score, cancer stage, cancer grade, smoking status, colorectal surgery, chemotherapy, family history of bowel cancer, raised platelet count, abnormal liver function, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prescribed aspirin at diagnosis, and prescribed statins at diagnosis. Improved survival in women was associated with younger age, earlier stage of cancer, well or moderately differentiated cancer grade, colorectal cancer surgery (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50), family history of bowel cancer (0.62), and prescriptions for statins (0.77) and aspirin (0.83) at diagnosis, with comparable results for men. The risk equations were well calibrated, with predicted risks closely matching observed risks. Discrimination was good in men and women in both validation cohorts. For example, the five year survival equations on the QResearch validation cohort explained 45.3\% of the variation in time to colorectal cancer death for women, the D statistic was 1.86, and Harrell’s C statistic was 0.80 (both measures of discrimination, indicating that the scores are able to distinguish between people with different levels of risk). The corresponding results for all cause mortality were 42.6\%, 1.77, and 0.79. Conclusions Risk prediction equations were developed and validated to estimate overall and conditional survival of patients with colorectal cancer accounting for an individual’s clinical and demographic characteristics. These equations can provide more individualised accurate information for patients with colorectal cancer to inform decision making and follow-up.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate version two of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (QRISK2) to provide accurate estimates of cardiovascular risk in patients from different ethnic groups in England and Wales and to compare its performance with the modified version of Framingham score recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). DESIGN: Prospective open cohort study with routinely collected data from general practice, 1 January 1993 to 31 March 2008. SETTING: 531 practices in England and Wales contributing to the national QRESEARCH database. PARTICIPANTS: 2.3 million patients aged 35-74 (over 16 million person years) with 140,000 cardiovascular events. Overall population (derivation and validation cohorts) comprised 2.22 million people who were white or whose ethnic group was not recorded, 22,013 south Asian, 11,595 black African, 10,402 black Caribbean, and 19,792 from Chinese or other Asian or other ethnic groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First (incident) diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic attack) recorded in general practice records or linked Office for National Statistics death certificates. Risk factors included self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol:high density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative under 60 years, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, type 2 diabetes, renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatoid arthritis. RESULTS: The validation statistics indicated that QRISK2 had improved discrimination and calibration compared with the modified Framingham score. The QRISK2 algorithm explained 43\% of the variation in women and 38\% in men compared with 39\% and 35\%, respectively, by the modified Framingham score. Of the 112,156 patients classified as high risk (that is, {$>$}or=20\% risk over 10 years) by the modified Framingham score, 46,094 (41.1\%) would be reclassified at low risk with QRISK2. The 10 year observed risk among these reclassified patients was 16.6\% (95\% confidence interval 16.1\% to 17.0\%)-that is, below the 20\% treatment threshold. Of the 78 024 patients classified at high risk on QRISK2, 11,962 (15.3\%) would be reclassified at low risk by the modified Framingham score. The 10 year observed risk among these patients was 23.3\% (22.2\% to 24.4\%)-that is, above the 20\% threshold. In the validation cohort, the annual incidence rate of cardiovascular events among those with a QRISK2 score of {$>$}or=20\% was 30.6 per 1000 person years (29.8 to 31.5) for women and 32.5 per 1000 person years (31.9 to 33.1) for men. The corresponding figures for the modified Framingham equation were 25.7 per 1000 person years (25.0 to 26.3) for women and 26.4 (26.0 to 26.8) for men). At the 20\% threshold, the population identified by QRISK2 was at higher risk of a CV event than the population identified by the Framingham score. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating ethnicity, deprivation, and other clinical conditions into the QRISK2 algorithm for risk of cardiovascular disease improves the accuracy of identification of those at high risk in a nationally representative population. At the 20\% threshold, QRISK2 is likely to be a more efficient and equitable tool for treatment decisions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As the validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage." Further validation in other populations is therefore advised.},

  abstract = {In a prospective multicenter study, 368 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients aged 15 to 65 years were treated with an intensified induction and reinduction regimen; 272 (73.9\%) achieved complete remission (CR). The median remission duration (MRD) is 24.3 months, and the probability of being in continuous CR (CCR) at greater than 5 years is .37. The median survival for all 368 patients is 27.5 months, and the probability of being alive at 5 years is .39. For the 272 patients in remission the median survival is 58.4 months, and the probability of being alive at 5 years is .49. A lower CR rate was seen for patients with bleeding at diagnosis or with splenomegaly/hepatosplenomegaly. The prognostic factors unfavorable for remission duration were time to CR greater than 4 weeks v less than 4 weeks (P = .0002), age greater than 35 years v less than 35 years (P = .0008), leukocyte count greater than 30,000/microL v less than 30,000/microL (P = .0112), and null ALL v common ALL (c-ALL)/T cell ALL (T-ALL) (P = .05). The remission duration correlated strongly (P = .0001) with the number of these independent prognostic factors. In patients with none of these adverse factors the MRD has not yet been reached, with one adverse factor the MRD is 21.9 months, and with two or three adverse factors the MRD is only 9.6 months. For the immunologic subtype T-ALL, the probability of being in CCR at greater than 5 years is .55; for c-ALL, .34; and for null ALL, .24. According to these results, patients were stratified into a low-risk group with a CCR rate of .62 and a high-risk group with a CCR rate of .28, with the latter now allocated to either further chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation in first remission.},

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) registries with more comprehensive reporting may also provide complementary data on treatment outcome to those obtained from clinical trials. Reports from several European CML registries consistently show a crude annual incidence of 0.7–1.0/100,000, a median age at diagnosis of 57–60 years and a male/female ratio of 1.2–1.7. The incidence of CML has been stable over time. Worldwide, variations in the reported incidence of CML may be due to methodological issues, but a true difference between different geographical areas and/or ethnical subgroups cannot be excluded. The prevalence of CML is not well known but has been estimated to be 10–12/100,000 inhabitants with a steady increase due to the dramatic improvement in survival of these patients. In recent population-based studies, CML patients have an overall survival that is comparable to that shown in large clinical trials, though relative survival in patients {$>$}70 years is still decreased. The importance of socio-economic factors and health-care setting for outcome and the possible increased risk of secondary cancer in CML are areas of ongoing research.},

Our objective was to assess the risk of OAC in a Swedish unselected cohort of individuals with BO. This population-based cohort study included all Swedish residents diagnosed with BO in 2006–2013, identified through the Swedish Patient Registry. The cohort members were followed from the date of first BO diagnosis until the first occurrence of OAC, high-grade dysplasia (HGD), death, emigration~or end of study period. The main outcome was incidence rates with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of OAC. Among 7932 participants with BO and 18,415 person-years of follow-up, the overall incidence of OAC was 1.47 (95\% CI 0.91–2.02) per 1000 person-years. When stratified into follow-up periods after BO diagnosis, the incidence rate of OAC was 15.53 (4.77–26.29) from 7 to 30~d, 4.10 (0.82–7.38) from 31 to 100~d, 1.87 (0.00–3.99) from 101~d~to 6 months, 1.44 (0.18–2.70) from {$>$}6 months to 1 year, 0.94 (0.36–1.53) from {$>$}1 year to 3 years and 2.17 (1.14–3.21) from {$>$}3 years to the end of follow-up. The median follow-up time was 2.13 person-years. This population-based study indicates that OAC is primarily diagnosed during the first months following an initial diagnosis of BO. This could justify a changed surveillance strategy of BO with a repeated thorough endoscopy shortly after initial BO diagnosis to identify prevalent early OAC or HGD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatogenous diabetes is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to examine the clinical and therapeutic implications and the prognostic significance of hepatogenous diabetes in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: The prospective cohort study was conducted in 52 patients with histologically confirmed liver cirrhosis (44\% Child A, 37\% Child B, 19\% Child C). The examination included a history, determination of basal C-peptide and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and, in some cases, a 3 h oral glucose tolerance test with 100 g glucose. Patients were also examined for signs of diabetic retinopathy and information on the further course of illness was obtained. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of patients with liver cirrhosis had manifest diabetes, 25\% had impaired glucose tolerance and only 4\% had normal glucose tolerance. In most cases, the hepatogenous diabetes was clinically asymptomatic. Sixteen percent of patients with hepatogenous diabetes had a family history of diabetes; only 8\% had retinopathic complications. Within 5.6 +/- 4.5 years after diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, 52\% of the diabetics had died, mainly of complications of the cirrhosis. There were no diabetes-associated or cardiovascular deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatogenous diabetes differs from type 2 diabetes in that there is less often a positive family history and that the cardiovascular and retinopathic risk is low. The prognosis of cirrhotic patients with diabetes is more likely to be negatively affected by the underlying hepatic disease and its complications than by the diabetes. Antihyperglycemic treatment of hepatogenous diabetes should always be carefully weighed up in each individual case.},

  abstract = {Background—Acute aortic dissection is a preventable life-threatening condition. However, there have been no prospective population-based studies of incidence or outcome to inform an understanding of risk factors, strategies for prevention, or projections for future clinical service provision. Methods and Results—We prospectively determined incidence and outcomes of all acute aortic dissections in a population of 92 728 in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, from 2002 to 2012. Among 155 patients with 174 acute aortic events, 54 patients had 59 thoracoabdominal aortic dissections (52 incident events: 6/100 000, 95\% confidence interval, 4–7; 37 Stanford type A, 15 Stanford type B; 31 men, mean age=72.0 years). Among patients with type A incident events, 18 (48.6\%) died before hospital assessment (61.1\% women). The 30-day fatality rate was 47.4\% for patients with type A dissections who survived to hospital admission and 13.3\% for patients with type B dissections, although subsequent 5-year survival rates were high (85.7\% for type A; 83.3\% for type B). Even though 67.3\% of patients were on antihypertensive drugs, 46.0\% of all patients had at least 1 systolic BP ≥180 mm Hg in their primary care records over the preceding 5 years, and the proportion of blood pressures in the hypertensive range ({$>$}140/90 mm Hg) averaged 56.0\%. Premorbid blood pressure was higher in patients with type A dissections that were immediately fatal than in those who survived to admission (mean/standard deviation pre-event systolic blood pressure=151.2/19.3 versus 137.9/17.9; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions—Uncontrolled hypertension remains the most significant treatable risk factor for acute aortic dissection. Prospective population-based ascertainment showed that hospital-based registries will underestimate not only incidence and case fatality, but also the association with premorbid hypertension.},

However, the timing of and the subtype of CRC that would benefit the most from using aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in relation to survival is unclear.Patients and MethodsIn all, 2,419 patients age 18 to 74 years with incident invasive CRC who were diagnosed from 1997 to 2008 were identified from population-based cancer registries in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Detailed epidemiologic questionnaires were administered at study enrollment and at 5-year follow-up. Survival outcomes were completed through linkage to national death registries. BRAF- and KRAS-mutation status, microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype were also evaluated. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs for overall survival (OS) and CRC-specific survival.ResultsAfter a median of 10.8 years of follow-up since diagnosis, 381 deaths (100 as a result of CRC) were observed. Compared with nonusers, postdiagnostic aspirin-only users had more favorable OS (HR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.59 to 0.95) and CRC-specific survival (HR, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.25 to 0.71), especially among those who initiated aspirin use (OS: HR, 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.47 to 0.86; CRC-specific survival: HR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 0.80). The association between any NSAID use after diagnosis and OS differed significantly by KRAS-mutation status (Pinteraction = .01). Use of any NSAID after diagnosis was associated with improved OS only among participants with KRAS wild-type tumors (HR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.80) but not among those with KRAS-mutant tumors (HR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 1.96).ConclusionAmong long-term CRC survivors, regular use of NSAIDs after CRC diagnosis was significantly associated with improved survival in individuals with KRAS wild-type tumors.},

  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESISThere is limited information about the impact of type 1 diabetes on life expectancy in a contemporary population. We examined the life expectancy of type 1 diabetic patients and explored the contribution of mortality at different ages and of different causes of death to years of life lost (YLL) compared with the general population.METHODSWe derived mortality rates of Australians with type 1 diabetes listed on the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) between 1997 and 2010 (n\,=\,85,547) by linking the NDSS to the National Death Index. The Chiang method was used to estimate life expectancy and Arriaga's method was used to estimate the contributions of age-specific and cause-specific mortality to the YLL.RESULTSA total of 5,981 deaths were identified during the 902,136 person-years of follow up. Type 1 diabetic patients had an estimated life expectancy at birth of 68.6~years (95\% CI 68.1, 69.1), which was 12.2~years (95\% CI 11.8, 12.7) less than that in the general population. The improvement in life expectancy at birth in 2004-2010 compared with 1997-2003 was similar for both type 1 diabetic patients (men, 1.9~years [95\% CI 0.4, 3.3]; women, 1.5~years [95\% CI 0.0, 3.2]) and the general population (men, 2.2~years; women, 1.4~years). Deaths at age {$<$}60~years accounted for 60\% of the YLL from type 1 diabetes for men and 45\% for women. The major contribution to YLL was mortality from endocrine and metabolic disease at age 10-39~years (men, 39-59\%; women, 35-50\%) and from circulatory disease at age ≥40~years (men, 43-75\%; women, 34-75\%).CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONData from 1997 to 2010 showed that Australian type 1 diabetic patients had an estimated loss in life expectancy at birth of 12.2~years compared with the general population.},

  abstract = {Background Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may potentially modify and decrease the risk for development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus (BO). Aim To investigate if the intensity and adherence of PPI use among all patients with BO in Denmark affected the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Methods We performed a nationwide case–control study in Denmark among 9883 patients with a new diagnosis of BO. All incident oesophageal adenocarcinomas and high-grade dysplasias were identified, and risk ratios were estimated on the basis of prior use of PPIs. Sex- and age-matched BO patients without dysplasia or malignancies in a 10:1 ratio were used for comparison. Conditional logistic regression was used for analysis, adjusting for low-grade dysplasia, gender and medication. Results We identified 140 cases with incident oesophageal adenocarcinomas and/or high-grade dysplasia, with a median follow-up time of 10.2~years. The relative risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia was 2.2 (0.7–6.7) and 3.4 (95\% CI: 1.1–10.5) in long-term low- and high-adherence PPI users respectively. Conclusions No cancer-protective effects from PPI's were seen. In fact, high-adherence and long-term use of PPI were associated with a significantly increased risk of adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia. This could partly be due to confounding by indication or a true negative effect from PPIs. Until the results from future studies hopefully can elucidate the association further, continuous PPI therapy should be directed at symptom control and additional modalities considered as aid or replacement.},

  abstract = {Purpose Primary lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancers. Comorbidity has been shown to be a negative prognostic factor in the overall lung cancer population. The significance of the individual comorbidities is less well known. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of each comorbid disease groups on survival. MethodsThe analysis is based on all patients with NSCLC who were registered in 2009–2011, in total 10,378 patients. To estimate the effect of each comorbidity group on the survival, we fitted a Cox regression model for each comorbidity group adjusting for age, sex, resection, and stage.ResultsPatients with cardiovascular comorbidity have a 30 \% higher death rate [HR 1.30 with 95 \% CI (1.13; 1.49)] than patients without comorbidity. Patients with diabetes and patients with cerebrovascular disorders and COPD have a 20 \% excess mortality than patients without comorbidity: [HR 1.19 with CI (1.02; 1.39) for diabetes, HR 1.18 with CI (1.05; 1.33) for cerebrovascular disorders, and HR 1.20 with CI (1.10; 1.39 for COPD)].ConclusionOur study shows the importance of cardiovascular disease in lung cancer. Diabetes, cerebrovascular disorders, and COPD also have a significant impact on survival of NSCLC patients.},

A U-shaped relationship between baseline eGFR and mortality was observed. After adjustment for potential confounders, eGFRs {$<$}45 and {$>$}105 mL/min/1.73 m2 remained associated significantly with increased risk of death. Baseline eGFR {$<$}90 mL/min/1.73 m2 was associated with increased risk of kidney disease progression, with the highest incidence rates of stages 4-5 CKD ({$>$}3 events/100 person-years) observed in black patients with eGFR of 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 and those of white/other ethnicity with eGFR of 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2. Limitations The relatively small numbers of patients with decreased eGFR at baseline and low rates of progression to stages 4-5 CKD and lack of data for diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria.

However, studies of health effects of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive.ObjectiveTo assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsVital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.Main Outcome MeasureAll-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.ResultsFine particulate and sulfur oxide–related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-µg/m3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4\%, 6\%, and 8\% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively. Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.ConclusionLong-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.},

We contacted the principal investigators of these 13 trials, of which eight agreed to include individual patient data. We used the individual patient data from these phase 3 trials from France, Germany, Poland, the UK, and the USA to create the full analysis dataset. The full analysis dataset was randomly divided, using a random sample procedure, into training and internal-validation datasets. We did a univariate analysis and multivariate analyses using 27 baseline factors and overall survival as an endpoint. We assigned weighted risk scores to each factor included in the final multivariable model. We assessed the discriminatory value using \emph{C}-statistics and also the validity and reproducibility of the CLL-IPI by subgroup analysis. We used two additional datasets from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA; MAYO cohort) and the SCALE Scandinavian population-based case-control study (SCAN cohort) as the external-validation datasets.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}3472 treatment-naive patients were included in the full analysis dataset; 2308 were randomly segregated into the training dataset and 1164 into the internal-validation dataset. 838 patients were included in the MAYO cohort and 416 in the SCAN cohort. Median age of patients in the full analysis dataset was 61 years (range 27–86). Five independent prognostic factors were identified in the training dataset: \emph{TP53} status (no abnormalities \emph{vs} del[17p] or \emph{TP53} mutation or both), \emph{IGHV} mutational status (mutated \emph{vs} unmutated), serum β\textsubscript{2}-microglobulin concentration (≤3·5 mg/L \emph{vs} {$>$}3·5 mg/L), clinical stage (Binet A or Rai 0 \emph{vs} Binet B–C or Rai I–IV), and age (≤65 years \emph{vs} {$>$}65 years). Using a weighted grading of the independent factors, a prognostic index was derived that identified four risk groups within the training dataset with significantly different overall survival at 5 years: low (93·2\% [95\% CI 90·5–96·0]), intermediate (79·3\% [75·5–83·2]), high (63·3\% [57·9–68·8]), and very high risk (23·3\% [12·5–34·1]; log-rank test comparing survival across the four risk groups p{$<$}0·0001; \emph{C}-statistic, c=0·723 [95\% CI 0·684–0·752]).

Design: Cross-sectional validation study of sedentary individuals. Subjects: The Heritage Family Study cohort of 665 black and white men and women who ranged in age from 17 to 65 y. Measurements: Body density determined from hydrostatic weighing. Percentage body fat determined with gender and race-specific, two-compartment models. BMI determined from height and weight, and sex and race in dummy coded form. Results: Polynomial regression showed that the relationship between \%fat and BMI was quadratic for both men and women. A natural log transformation of BMI adjusted for the non-linearity. Test for homogeneity of log transformed BMI and gender showed that the male-female slopes were within random variance, but the intercepts differed. For the same BMI, the \%fat of females was 10.4\% higher than that of males. General linear models analysis of the women's data showed that age, race and race-by-BMI interaction were independently related to \%fat. The same analysis applied to the men's data showed that \%fat was not just a function of BMI, but also age and age-by-BMI interaction. Multiple regression analyses provided models that defined the bias. Conclusions: These data and results published in the literature show that BMI and \%fat relationship are not independent of age and gender. These data showed a race effect for women, but not men. The failure to adjust for these sources of bias resulted in substantial differences in the proportion of subjects defined as obese by measured \%fat.},

Methods and Results—PREDICT was based on information routinely collected in hospital. Predictors abstracted from hospital record items pertaining to the admission day, including shock, heart failure, ECG findings, cardiovascular disease history, kidney function, and age. Comorbidity was assessed from discharge diagnoses, and mortality was determined from death certificates. For 1985 and 1990 hospitalizations, the 6-year death rate in 6134 patients with 0 to 1 score points was 4\%, increasing stepwise to 89\% for ≥16 points. Score validity was established by only slightly attenuated mortality prediction in 3570 admissions in 1970 and 1980. When case severity was controlled for, 6-year risk declined 32\% between 1970 and 1990. When PREDICT was held constant, 24\% of those treated with thrombolysis died in 6 years compared with 31\% of those not treated.

Results During follow-up, 461 participants (44.0\%) died, including 158 deaths from CVD. PAD participants in the lowest baseline quartile of the WIQ stair-climbing scores had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08-2.66, P = .02) and higher CVD mortality (hazard ratio, 3.11; 95\% confidence interval, 1.30-7.47, P = .01) compared with those with the highest baseline WIQ stair-climbing score. Among PAD participants, there were no significant associations of lower baseline WIQ distance or speed scores with rates of all-cause mortality (P = .20 and P = .07 for trend, respectively) or CVD mortality (P = .51 and P = .33 for trend, respectively). Among non-PAD participants there were no significant associations of lower baseline WIQ stair-climbing, distance, or speed score with rates of all-cause mortality (P = .94, P = .69, and P = .26, for trend, respectively) or CVD mortality (P = .28, P = .68, and P = .78, for trend, respectively). Conclusions Among participants with PAD, lower WIQ stair-climbing scores are associated with higher all-cause and CVD mortality, independently of the ABI and other covariates.},

Therefore we aimed to confirm and quantify the predictive value of serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides in liver cirrhosis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study on consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis (n = 191). Relevant clinical and laboratory variables were obtained from patients' charts and patients were followed for two months. Mortality was the main outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients died in the follow-up period. Significant difference was observed in the level of total serum cholesterol between surviving and deceased patients (2.27 ± 1.02 mmol/L vs. 2.97 ± 1.00 mmol/L, P {$<$} 0.0001 respectively). Cholesterol was confirmed as a significant predictor of mortality in univariate logistic regression analysis, and independent predictor beside bilirubin, creatinine and MELD score in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Addition of serum cholesterol level to a prognostic model based on total bilirubin, creatinine and INR increased its accuracy by 4\%. Adding cholesterol to the MELD score improved prediction accuracy by 3\%. There was no significant difference in serum levels of triglycerides between surviving and deceased patients. CONCLUSION: Serum cholesterol is a routinely measured parameter, which has independent prognostic value in patients with liver cirrhosis.},

A variance-based method of meta-analysis was used to summarize the relationships from available studies. The summary relative risk of all-cause mortality from the 26 analyses that included a risk estimate for a BMI within the overweight range was 1.00 (95\% confidence intervals, 0.97–1.03). The summary relative risk of all-cause mortality for the 28 analyses that included a risk estimate for a BMI within the obese range was 1.10 (1.06–1.13). These calculations indicate that a BMI in the overweight range is not associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality in the elderly, while a BMI in the moderately obese range is only associated with a modest increase in mortality risk.},

For the physician there are few clinical tools available to help quantify survival chances after transplantation. We used registry data to develop a series of tables that could be used in the clinical setting to predict survival probability. Using data from the Canadian Organ Replacement Registry, we generated clinical survival tables using Cox's regression model. Model covariates included age, race, gender, treatment period, primary renal disease cause, donor source, months on dialysis and comorbidities. A total of 6324 patients were included, 22\% had ≥1 comorbid condition at baseline. After adjustment for age, gender and cause of renal disease, increased comorbidity was strongly associated with reduced patient-survival (P {$<$} 0.05). Age and comorbidity specific clinical survival tables showing the expected 1-, 3- and 5-year patient survival probabilities were generated. Separate tables were created for diabetics, nondiabetics, living-donor organs and deceased-donor transplantation. Patient-specific survival data can be estimated from registry data. We suggest annual or biannual tables generated by national registries across Europe and N. America, may be useful to those physicians faced with counseling patients and families.},

We examined associations between lifestyle factors measured before diagnosis and CRC survival. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study collected data on alcohol intake, cigarette smoking and physical activity, and body measurements at baseline (1990-94) and wave 2 (2003-07). We included participants diagnosed to 31 August 2015 with incident stage I-III CRC within 10-years post exposure assessment. Information on tumor characteristics and vital status was obtained. Tumor DNA was tested for microsatellite instability (MSI) and somatic mutations in oncogenes BRAF (V600E) and KRAS. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for associations between lifestyle factors and overall and CRC-specific mortality using Cox regression. Of 724 eligible CRC cases, 339 died (170 from CRC) during follow-up (average 9.0 years). Exercise (non-occupational/leisure-time) was associated with higher CRC-specific survival for stage II (HR = 0.25, 95\% CI: 0.10-0.60) but not stage I/III disease (p for interaction = .01), and possibly for colon and KRAS wild-type tumors. Waist circumference was inversely associated with CRC-specific survival (HR = 1.25 per 10 cm increment, 95\% CI: 1.08-1.44), independent of stage, anatomic site and tumor molecular status. Cigarette smoking was associated with lower overall survival, with suggestive evidence of worse survival for BRAF mutated CRC, but not with CRC-specific survival. Alcohol intake was not associated with survival. Survival did not differ by MSI status. We have identified pre-diagnostic predictors of survival following CRC that may have clinical and public health relevance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The clinical course of alcoholic cirrhosis, a condition with a high mortality, has not been well described. We examined prevalence, risk, chronology, and mortality associated with three complications of cirrhosis: ascites, variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy. We followed a population-based cohort of 466 Danish patients diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis in 1993–2005, starting from the date of hospital diagnosis and ending in August 2006. Data were extracted from medical charts during the follow-up period. Risk and mortality associated with complications were calculated using competing-risks methods. At diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis, 24\% of patients had no complications, 55\% had ascites alone, 6\% had variceal bleeding alone, 4\% had ascites and variceal bleeding, and 11\% had hepatic encephalopathy. One-year mortality was 17\% among patients with no initial complications, 20\% following variceal bleeding alone, 29\% following ascites alone, 49\% following ascites and variceal bleeding (from the onset of the later of the two complications), and 64\% following hepatic encephalopathy. Five-year mortality ranged from 58\% to 85\%. The risk of complications was about 25\% after 1 year and 50\% after 5 years for all patients without hepatic encephalopathy. The complications under study did not develop in any predictable sequence. Although patients initially without complications usually developed ascites first (12\% within 1 year), many developed either variceal bleeding first (6\% within 1 year) or hepatic encephalopathy first (4\% within 1 year). Subsequent complications occurred in an unpredictable order among patients with ascites or variceal bleeding. Conclusion: Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had a high prevalence of complications at the time of cirrhosis diagnosis. The presence and type of complications at diagnosis were predictors of mortality, but not of the risk of subsequent complications. (HEPATOLOGY 2010.)},

  abstract = {Patients with liver cirrhosis have a high mortality, not just from cirrhosis-related causes, but also from other causes. This observation indicates that many patients with cirrhosis have other chronic diseases, yet the prognostic impact of comorbidities has not been examined. Using data from a nationwide Danish population-based hospital registry, we identified patients who were diagnosed with cirrhosis between 1995 and 2006 and computed their burden of comorbidity using the Charlson comorbidity index. We compared survival between comorbidity groups, adjusting for alcoholism, sex, age, and calendar period. We also examined the risks of cirrhosis-related and non–cirrhosis-related death using data from death certificates and identified a matched comparison cohort without cirrhosis from the Danish population. We included 14,976 cirrhosis patients, 38\% of whom had one or more comorbidities. The overall 1-year survival probability was 65.5\%; the 10-year survival probability was 21.5\%. Compared with patients with a Charlson comorbidity index of 0, the mortality rate was increased 1.17-fold in patients with an index of 1 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.11–1.23], 1.51-fold in patients with an index of 2 (95\% CI, 1.42–1.62), and two-fold in patients with an index of 3 or higher (95\% CI, 1.85–2.15). In the first year of follow-up, but not later, comorbidity increased the risk of cirrhosis-related death, and this was consistent with an apparent synergy between the cirrhosis and comorbidity effects on mortality in the same period. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that comorbidity is an important prognostic factor for patients with cirrhosis. Successful treatment of comorbid diseases in the first year after diagnosis may substantially reduce the mortality rate. (HEPATOLOGY 2008.)},

  abstract = {Background: Published studies about the association of obesity with mortality have used body mass index (BMI) data collected more than 10 years ago, potentially limiting their current applicability, particularly given evidence of a secular decline in obesity-related mortality. The objective of this study was to examine the association between BMI and mortality in a representative, contemporary United States sample. Methods: This was a population-based observational study of data from 50,994 adults aged 18 to 90 years who responded to the 2000 to 2005 Medical Expenditures Panel Surveys. Cox regression analyses were employed to model survival during up to 6 years of follow-up (ascertained via National Death Index linkage) by self-reported BMI category (underweight, {$<$}20 kg/m2; normal weight, 20-{$<$}25 [reference]; overweight, 25-{$<$}30; obese, 30-{$<$}35; severely obese, ≥35), without and with adjustment for diabetes and hypertension. Survival by BMI category also was modeled for diabetic and hypertensive individuals. All models were adjusted for sociodemographics, smoking, and Medical Expenditures Panel Surveys response year. Results: In analyses not adjusted for diabetes or hypertension, only severe obesity was associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.26; 95\% confidence interval, 1.00–1.59). After adjusting for diabetes and hypertension, severe obesity was no longer associated with mortality, and milder obesity (BMI 30-{$<$}35) was associated with decreased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.81; 95\% confidence interval, 0.68–0.97). There was a significant interaction between diabetes (but not hypertension) and BMI (F [4, 235] = 2.71; P = .03), such that the mortality risk of diabetes was lower among mildly and severely obese persons than among those in lower BMI categories. Conclusions: Obesity-associated mortality risk was lower than estimated in studies employing older BMI data. Only severe obesity (but not milder obesity or overweight) was associated with increased mortality, an association accounted for by coexisting diabetes and hypertension. Mortality in diabetes was lower among obese versus normal weight individuals.},

  abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of the combined model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and blood lipid level in patients with decompensated cirrhosis., METHODS: A total of 198 patients with decompensated cirrhosis were enrolled into the study. The values of triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (TC), high density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) of each patient on the first day of admission were retrieved from the medical records, and MELD was calculated. All the patients were followed up for 1 year. The relationship between the change of blood lipid level and the value of MELD score was studied by analysis of variance. The prognostic factors were screened by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Draw Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn., RESULTS: Forty-five patients died within 3 mo and 83 patients died within 1 year. The levels of TG, TC, HDL and LDL of the death group were all lower than those of the survivors. The serum TG, TC, HDL and LDL levels were lowered with the increase of the MELD score. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model showed that MELD ≥ 18 and TC ≤ 2.8 mmol/L were independent risk factors for prognosis of decompensated cirrhosis. Survival analysis showed that MELD ≥ 18 combined with TC ≤ 2.8 mmol/L can clearly discriminate between the patients who would survive and die in 1 year., CONCLUSION: MELD ≥ 18 and TC ≤ 2.8 mmol/L are two important indexes to predict the prognosis of patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Their combination can effectively predict the long-term prognosis of patients with decompensated cirrhosis.},

Using data from the UK General Practice Research Database, we identified MS cases diagnosed during 2001–2006 and validated using patients’ original records where possible. We also included MS cases during 1993–2000 identified and validated in an earlier study. Cases were matched to up to ten referents without MS by age, sex, index date (date of first MS diagnosis for cases and equivalent reference date for controls), general practice and length of medical history before first MS diagnosis. Patients were followed up to identify deaths; hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox-proportional regression. MS patients (N = 1,822) had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with referents (N = 18,211); adjusted HR 1.7 (95 \% CI 1.4–2.1). Compared with referents, female MS patients had a higher but not significantly different HR for death than males; adjusted HR 1.86 (95 \% CI 1.46–2.38) vs. HR 1.31 (95 \% CI 0.93–1.84), respectively. The most commonly recorded cause of death in MS patients was ‘MS’ (41 \%), with a higher proportion recorded among younger patients. A significantly higher proportion of referents than MS patients had cancer recorded as cause of death (40 vs. 19 \%). Patients with MS have a significant 1.7-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with the general population. MS is the most commonly recorded cause of death among MS patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most commonly used predictive equation for basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the Schofield equation, which only uses information on body weight, age and sex to derive the prediction. However, because body composition is a key influencing factor, there will be error in calculating an individual's basal requirements based on this prediction. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether adding additional anthropometric measures to the standard measures can enhance the predictability of BMR and to cross-validate this within a separate subgroup. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 150 Caucasian adults from Scotland, with a body mass index range of 16.7-49.3 kg/m(2). All subjects underwent measurement of BMR, body composition, and 148 also had basic skinfold and circumference measures taken. The resultant equation was tested in a subgroup of 39 obese males. RESULTS: The average difference between the predicted (Schofield equation) and measured BMR was 502 kJ/day. There was a slight systematic bias in this error, with the Schofield equation underestimating the lowest values. The average discrepancy between predicted and actual BMR was reduced to 452 kJ/day, with the addition of fat mass, fat-free mass, an overall 10\% improvement on the Schofield equation (P=0.054). Using an equation derived from principal components analysis of anthropometry measurements similarly decreased the difference to 458 kJ/day (P=0.039). Testing the equation in a separate group indicated a 33\% improvement in predictability of BMR, compared to the Schofield equation. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of detailed information on body composition, utilizing anthropometric data provides a useful alternative methodology to improve the predictability of BMR beyond that achieved from the standard Schofield prediction equation. This should be confirmed in more individuals, both within the obese and normal weight category.},

  abstract = {The treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed greatly over the past 15 years. Progress in the surgical management of the primary tumor and increased understanding of the molecular biology and genomics of the disease have led to the development of new therapeutic agents. The management of the primary tumor has changed owing to the realization that clean margins around the primary lesion are sufficient to prevent local recurrence, as well as the development of more sophisticated tools and techniques that increase the safety of partial nephrectomy. The management of advanced disease has altered even more dramatically as a result of new agents that target the tumor vasculature or that attenuate the activation of intracellular oncogenic pathways. This review summarizes data from prospective randomized phase III studies on the surgical management and systemic treatment of RCC, and provides an up to date summary of the histology, genomics, staging, and prognosis of RCC. It describes the management of the primary tumor and offers an overview of systemic agents that form the mainstay of treatment for advanced disease. The review concludes with an introduction to the exciting new class of immunomodulatory agents that are currently in clinical trials and may form the basis of a new therapeutic approach for patients with advanced RCC.},

  abstract = {Background Reported incidence rates of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) in Barrett's oesophagus (BO) vary widely. As the effectiveness of BO surveillance is crucially dependent on this rate, its clarification is essential. Methods To estimate the rate of malignant progression in patients with BO, all patients with a first diagnosis of BO with no dysplasia (ND) or low-grade dysplasia (LGD) between 1991 and 2006 were identified in the Dutch nationwide registry of histopathology (PALGA). Follow-up data were evaluated up to November 2007. Results 42 207 patients with BO were included; 4132 (8\%) of them had LGD. Re-evaluation endoscopies at least 6 months after initial diagnosis were performed in 16 365 patients (39\%), who were significantly younger than those not re-examined (58±13 vs 63±16 years, p{$<$}0.001). These patients were followed-up for a total of 78 131 person-years, during which 666 (4\%) high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/OACs occurred, affecting 4\% of the surveillance patient population (mean age: 69±12 years, 76\% male). After excluding HGD/OAC cases detected within 1 year after BO diagnosis (n=212, 32\%), incidence rates per 1000 person-years were 4.3 (95\% CI 3.4 to 5.5) for OAC and 5.8 (95\% CI 4.6 to 7.0) for HGD/OAC combined. Risk factors for HGD/OAC were increased age (eg, {$>$}75 years HR 12; 95\% CI 8.0 to 18), male sex (2.01; 1.68 to 2.60) and presence of LGD at baseline (1.91; 1.53 to 2.40). Conclusion In this largest reported cohort of unselected patients with BO, the annual risk of OAC was 0.4\%. Male sex, older age and LGD at diagnosis are independent predictors of malignant progression, and should enable an improved risk assessment in BO.},

There is a need to characterize and account for the survival and prognostic factors among a population- based cohort of ALS cases in the United States. Methods A cohort of incident cases diagnosed from 2009–2011 in New Jersey was followed until death or December 31, 2013, whichever happened first. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify prognostic factors. Results Sixty-four percent of incident cases died between 2009 and 2013, 93.7\% specifically from ALS. Among the 456 cases studied in the survival analysis, the median survival from diagnosis was 21 months; 46\% of cases survived longer than two years from diagnosis. Older age predicted shorter survival. While there is some indication of differences because of sex, race, and ethnicity, these differences were not statistically significant when accounting for age. Conclusions New Jersey mortality data were queried to determine the vital status of a cohort of incident ALS cases and used to investigate relationships between demographic factors and survival. Results are consistent with other population-based studies. Older age was a strong predictor of shorter survival time. Additional follow-up time is needed to characterize longer-term survival.},

Design, Subjects and Methods: The 45 and Up Study is a large-scale Australian cohort study initiated in 2006. Self-reported data from 158\,546 individuals with no history of CVD were linked prospectively to hospitalisation and mortality data. Hazard ratios (HRs) of incident hospitalisation for specific CVD diagnoses in relation to baseline BMI categories were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, region of residence, income, education, smoking, alcohol intake and health insurance status. Results: There were 9594 incident CVD admissions over 583\,100 person-years among people with BMI⩾20\,kg\,m−2, including 3096 for ischaemic heart disease (IHD), 1373 for stroke, 411 for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and 320 for heart failure. The adjusted HR of hospitalisation for all CVD diagnoses combined increased significantly with increasing BMI (P(trend) {$<$}0.0001)). The HR of IHD hospitalisation increased by 23\% (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 18–27\%) per 5\,kg\,m−2 increase in BMI (compared to BMI 20.0–22.49\,kg\,m−2, HR (95\% CI) for BMI categories were: 22.5–24.99=1.25 (1.08–1.44); 25–27.49=1.43 (1.24–1.65); 27.5–29.99=1.64 (1.42–1.90); 30–32.49=1.63 (1.39–1.91) and 32.5–50=2.10 (1.79–2.45)). The risk of hospitalisation for heart failure showed a significant, but nonlinear, increase with increasing BMI. No significant increase was seen with above-normal BMI for stroke or PVD. For other specific classifications of CVD, HRs of hospitalisation increased significantly with increasing BMI for: hypertension; angina; acute myocardial infarction; chronic IHD; pulmonary embolism; non-rheumatic aortic valve disorders; atrioventricular and left bundle-branch block; atrial fibrillation and flutter; aortic aneurysm; and phlebitis and thrombophlebitis. Conclusion: The risk of hospitalisation for a wide range of CVD subtypes increases with relatively fine increments in BMI. Obesity prevention strategies are likely to benefit from focusing on bringing down the mean BMI at the population level, in addition to targeting those with a high BMI.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 4,754 patients registered in the German Hodgkin's Lymphoma Study Group (GHSG) database between 1988 and 1999, 422 patients with early (n = 170) or late (n = 252) relapsed HD were identified. One hundred seven patients (25\%) relapsed after radiotherapy (RT) for early stages, 133 patients (32\%) after combined-modality therapy for intermediate stages, and 182 patients (43\%) after chemotherapy (CT) and RT to initial bulky disease or residual lymphoma for advanced stages. At relapse, characteristics of these 422 patients (median age, 38 years; range, 17 to 77) were stage III/IV, 45\%; B symptoms, 24\%; elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 29\%; anemia, 13\%; and Karnofsky performance score, less than 90 in 13\%. At first relapse, salvage treatment was RT in 13\%, CT in 54\%, and high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in 33\%. RESULTS: Median follow-up time after relapse was 45 months. Freedom from second failure (FF2F) and overall survival (OS) were 81\% and 89\% for relapse after RT, 33\% and 46\% for early relapse after CT, and 43\% and 71\% for late relapse after CT, respectively. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors were time to relapse, clinical stage at relapse, and anemia at relapse. Four subgroups with significantly different FF2F and OS were identified. The prognostic score was predictive for patients who relapsed after RT, CT with conventional CT salvage, and CT with HDCT/ASCT. CONCLUSION: In the GHSG database, time to relapse and clinical stage and anemia at relapse are relevant factors and can be used to form a prognostic score for HD patients at relapse.},

Results During the 17-year follow-up period 1597 deaths occurred. The presence of a mental disorder detected at baseline was associated with an elevated mortality rate. The relative risk in men was 1.6(95\% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and in women, 1.4 (95\% Cl 1.2-1.6). In men and women with schizophrenia the relative risks of death during the follow-up period were 3.3 (95\% Cl 2.3-4.9) and 2.3 (95\% Cl 1.3-3.8) respectively, compared with the rest of the sample. In both men and women with schizophrenia the risk of dying of respiratory disease was increased, but the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease was increased only in men with neurotic depression.

  abstract = {Background: The prevalence of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism is 0.5–4\% in iodine-replete communities, but it is 5–10 times higher in women than in men. Those conditions are associated with a broad range of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Biological evidence of a role of thyroid hormones in carcinogenesis also exists. However, the association between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular disease or cancer mortality risk remains controversial. In a large cohort of women, the associations of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism with cause-specific mortality were evaluated after nearly 30 years of follow-up. Methods: The prospective study included 75,076 women aged 20–89 years who were certified as radiologic technologists in the United States in 1926–1982, completed baseline questionnaires in 1983–1998 from which medical history was ascertained, and reported no malignant disease or benign thyroid disease except thyroid dysfunction. A passive follow-up of this cohort was performed through the Social Security Administration database and the National Death Index-Plus. Cause-specific mortality risks were compared according to self-reported thyroid status, with proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline year and age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, family history of breast cancer, and life-style and reproductive factors. Results: During a median follow-up of 28 years, 2609 cancer, 1789 cardiovascular or cerebrovascular, and 2442 other non-cancer deaths were recorded. Women with hyperthyroidism had an elevated risk of breast cancer mortality after 60 years of age (hazard ratio [HR]\,=\,2.04 [confidence interval (CI) 1.16–3.60], 13 cases in hyperthyroid women) compared to women without thyroid disease. Hypothyroid women had increased mortality risks for diabetes mellitus (HR\,=\,1.58 [CI 1.03–2.41], 27 cases in hypothyroid women), cardiovascular disease (HR\,=\,1.20 [CI 1.01–1.42], 179 cases), and cerebrovascular disease (HR\,=\,1.45 [CI 1.01–2.08], 35 cases, when restricting the follow-up to ≥10 years after baseline). Other causes of death were not associated with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, though there was a suggestion of an elevated risk of ovarian cancer mortality in hyperthyroid women based on very few cases. Conclusion: The excess mortality risks observed in a large, prospective 30-year follow-up of patients with thyroid dysfunction require confirmation, and, if replicated, further investigation will be needed because of the clinical implications.},

Mean systolic and diastolic differences (S, D, mmHg) were: (Table: see text). 1) SPH systolic BP underestimates HUM systolic BP. 2) Mean SEN measurements are very closed to HUM values. 3) A great intra-individual variability occurs since more than 50 per cent systolic SPH values show discrepancy of more than 10 mmHg for systolic and diastolic HUM BP; the same discrepancies occur for SEN vs HUM. 4) Differences between couples of values (HUM-SEN, HUM-SPH) are not correlated to BP level, neither for systolic nor for diastolic BP. 5) No significant correlation occurs when BP deltas are compared to weight index or arm circumference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We aimed to develop a multidimensional geriatric prognosis index (GPI) for 3- and 5-year mortality in community-dwelling elderly and to validate the GPI in a separate hospital-based population. The GPI was constructed using data for 988 participants in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA) and cross-validated with 1109 patients who underwent a geriatric assessment at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH). The GPI, with a total possible score of 8, included age, gender, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, comorbidities, mood, cognitive function, and nutritional status. During the 5-year observation period, 179 KLoSHA participants (18.1\%) and 340 SNUBH patients (30.7\%) died. The c-indices for 3- and 5-year mortality were 0.78 and 0.80, respectively, in the KLoSHA group and 0.73 and 0.80, respectively, in the SNUBH group. Positive linear trends were observed for GPI scores and both 3- and 5-year mortality in both groups. In conclusions, using common components of a geriatric assessment, the GPI can stratify the risk of 3- and 5-year mortality in Korean elderly people both in the community and hospital.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Increased mortality has been reported in Crohn's disease (CD) but mostly not in ulcerative colitis (UC). We evaluated the overall and cause-specific mortality in a nationwide cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Finland. METHODS: A total of 21,964 patients with IBD (16,649 with UC and 5315 with CD) from the Special Reimbursement register were diagnosed 1987-1993 and 2000-2007 and followed up to the end of 2010 by collating these figures with the national computerized Cause-of-Death Register of Statistics Finland. In each cause-of-death category, the number of deaths reported was compared to that expected in general population, and expressed as a standardized mortality ratio (SMR). RESULTS: Overall mortality was increased among patients with CD (SMR 1.33, 95\% confidence interval 1.21-1.46) and UC (1.10, 1.05-1.15). SMR was significantly increased for gastrointestinal causes in CD (6.53, 4.91-8.52) and UC (2.81, 2.32-3.34). Patients with UC were found also to have increased SMR from pulmonary (1.24, 1.02-1.46) and cardiovascular disease (1.14, 1.06-1.22) and cancers of the colon (1.90, 1.38-2.55), rectum (1.79, 1.14-2.69) and biliary tract (5.65, 3.54-8.54), whereas SMR from alcohol-related deaths was decreased (0.54, 0.39-0.71). Patients with CD had a significantly increased SMR for pulmonary diseases (2.01, 1.39-2.80), infections (4.27, 2.13-7.63) and cancers of the biliary tract (4.51, 1.23-11.5) and lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue (2.95, 1.85-4.45). CONCLUSIONS: In this Finnish nationwide study increased overall mortality in both CD and UC was observed. The excess mortality of 14\% in IBD is mainly due to deaths related to inflammation in the gut.},

  abstract = {Background As those with HIV infection live longer, ‘non-AIDS’ condition associated with immunodeficiency and chronic inflammation are more common. We ask whether ‘non-HIV’ biomarkers improve differentiation of mortality risk among individuals initiating combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods Using Poisson models, we analysed data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) on HIV-infected veterans initiating cART between 1 January 1997 and 1 August 2002. Measurements included: HIV biomarkers (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA and AIDS-defining conditions); ‘non-HIV’ biomarkers (haemoglobin, transaminases, platelets, creatinine, and hepatitis B and C serology); substance abuse or dependence (alcohol or drug); and age. Outcome was all cause mortality. We tested the discrimination (C statistics) of each biomarker group alone and in combination in development and validation data sets, over a range of survival intervals, and adjusting for missing data. Results Of veterans initiating cART, 9784 (72\%) had complete data. Of these, 2566 died. Subjects were middle-aged (median age 45 years), mainly male (98\%) and predominantly black (51\%). HIV and ‘non-HIV’ markers were associated with each other (P{$<$}0.0001) and discriminated mortality (C statistics 0.68–0.73); when combined, discrimination improved (P{$<$}0.0001). Discrimination for the VACS Index was greater for shorter survival intervals [30-day C statistic 0.86, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.80–0.91], but good for intervals of up to 8 years (C statistic 0.73, 95\% CI 0.72–0.74). Results were robust to adjustment for missing data. Conclusions When added to HIV biomarkers, ‘non-HIV’ biomarkers improve differentiation of mortality. When evaluated over similar intervals, the VACS Index discriminates as well as other established indices. After further validation, the VACS Index may provide a useful, integrated risk assessment for management and research.},

More thorough analyses utilizing phenotypic data over the life course may deepen our understanding of the development of BMI and thus help in the prevention of obesity. The authors used a structural equation modeling approach to explore the network of variables associated with BMI from the prenatal period to age 31 years (1965-1997) in 4,435 subjects from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. The use of structural equation modeling permitted the easy inclusion of variables with missing values in the analyses without separate imputation steps, as well as differentiation between direct and indirect effects. There was an association between the FTO single nucleotide polymorphism rs9939609 and BMI at age 31 years that persisted after controlling for several relevant factors during the life course. The total effect of the FTO variant on adult BMI was mostly composed of the direct effect, but a notable part was also arising indirectly via its effects on earlier BMI development. In addition to well-established genetic determinants, many life-course factors such as physical activity, in spite of not showing mediation or interaction, had a strong independent effect on BMI.},

Hysteroscopy with biopsy was performed. The study population was divided into four groups according to histopathological results of the endometrium: non-atypical endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyp, endometrial cancer and controls. Fasting glucose and insulin levels and OGTT, IR indexes, occurrence of diabetes, pre-diabetic state, overweight, obesity and hypertension were assessed. RESULTS: Insulin resistance was diagnosed in 41.0\% of the patients. The prevalence of markers of insulin resistance increased to 57.1\% in cases with confirmed endometrial pathology compared to 31.8\% in histologically normal endometrium (p{$<$}0.01). The frequency of insulin resistance was 52.6\% (p=0.059) and 55.5\% (p=0.04), respectively in women with non-atypical hyperplasia and patients with endometrial polyps when compared to the control group. Abnormal parameters of carbohydrate metabolism indicate little sensitivity and specificity in predicting endometrial hyperplastic lesions. The insulin levels at 120 minutes of OGTT correlate best with such changes (concentration {$>$}57 microU/ml in case of hyperplasia and {$>$}61 microU/ml in endometrial polyps). CONCLUSION: Insulin resistance and carbohydrate metabolism disturbances are common in women with endometrial pathologies. In these patients there is clinical basis for recommending lifestyle modification (change of diet, more physical activity), or for introduction of pharmaceutical insulin-sensitizing agents.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—It is unknown whether supraventricular arrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation or flutter are associated with stroke. Methods—To examine the association between paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and stroke, we performed a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data from all emergency department encounters and hospitalizations at California’s nonfederal acute care hospitals in 2009. Our cohort comprised all adult patients with ≥1 emergency department visit or hospitalization from which they were discharged alive and without a diagnosis of stroke. Our primary exposure was a diagnosis of PSVT recorded at an encounter before stroke or documented as present-on-admission at the time of stroke. To reduce confounding, we excluded patients with diagnoses of atrial fibrillation. We defined PSVT, stroke, and atrial fibrillation using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes previously validated by detailed chart review. Results—Of 4 806 830 eligible patients, 14 121 (0.29\%) were diagnosed with PSVT and 14 402 (0.30\%) experienced a stroke. The cumulative rate of stroke after PSVT diagnosis (0.94\%; 95\% confidence interval, 0.76\%–1.16\%) significantly exceeded the rate among patients without a diagnosis of PSVT (0.21\%; 95\% confidence interval, 0.21\%–0.22\%). In Cox proportional hazards analysis controlling for demographic characteristics and potential confounders, PSVT was independently associated with a higher risk of subsequent stroke (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95\% confidence interval, 1.69–2.62). Conclusions—In a large and demographically diverse sample of patients, we found an independent association between PSVT and ischemic stroke. PSVT seems to be a novel risk factor that may account for some proportion of strokes that are currently classified as cryptogenic.},

We examined the association between BMI and risk of breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality, and evaluated whether tumor characteristics differ by BMI among a mammographically-screened population with access to treatment. Methods Using a retrospective cohort study design, we followed 485 women aged ≥40 years diagnosed with stage I/II breast cancer within 24 months of a screening mammogram occurring between 1988 and 1993 for 10-year outcomes. BMI before diagnosis was categorized as normal ({$<$}25 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), and obese (≥30 kg/m2). Tumor marker expression was assessed via immunohistochemistry using tissue collected before adjuvant treatment. Medical records were abstracted to identify treatment, recurrence, and mortality. We used Cox proportional hazards to separately model the hazard ratios (HR) of our three outcomes by BMI while adjusting for age, stage, and tamoxifen use. Results Relative to normal weight women, obese women experienced increased risk of recurrence (HR-2.43; 95\%CI-1.34–4.41) and breast cancer death (HR-2.41; 95\%CI-1.00–5.81) within 10 years of diagnosis. There was no association between BMI and all-cause mortality. Obese women had significantly faster growing tumors, as measured by Ki-67. Conclusions Our findings add to the growing evidence that obesity may contribute to poorer breast cancer outcomes, and also suggest that increased tumor proliferation among obese women is a pathway that explains part of their excess risk of adverse outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generally have a poor prognosis. AML-type therapy results are often derived from studies in younger patients and may not apply to elderly AML. Many investigators and oncologists advocate, at times, only supportive care or frontline single agents, Phase I–II studies, low-intensity regimens, or ‘targeted’ therapies. However, baseline expectations for outcomes of elderly AML with ‘standard’ AML-type therapy are not well defined. The aim was to develop prognostic models for complete response (CR), induction (8-week) mortality, and survival rates in elderly AML, which would be used to advise oncologists and patients of expectations with standard AML type therapy, and to establish baseline therapy results against which novel strategies would be evaluated. METHODS A total of 998 patients age ≥ 65 years with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ({$>$} 10\% blasts) treated with intensive chemotherapy between 1980 and 2004 were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors associated with CR, induction (8-week) mortality, and survival used standard methods. RESULTS The overall CR rate was 45\% and induction mortality 29\%. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors identified consistent independent poor prognostic factors for CR, 8-week mortality, and survival. These included age ≥ 75 years, unfavorable karyotypes (often complex), poor performance (3–4 ECOG [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group]), longer duration of antecedent hematologic disorder, treatment outside the laminar airflow room, and abnormal organ functions. Patients could be divided into: 1) a favorable group (about 20\% of patients) with expected CR rates above 60\%, induction mortality rates of 10\%, and 1-year survival rates above 50\%; 2) an intermediate group (about 50–55\% of patients) with expected CR rates of 50\%, induction mortality rates of 30\%, and 1-year survival rates of 30\%; and 3) an unfavorable risk group (about 25–30\% of patients) with expected CR rates of less than 20\%, induction mortality rates above 50\%, and 1-year survival rates of less than 10\%. CONCLUSIONS Prognostic models, based on standard readily available baseline characteristics, were developed for elderly patients with AML, which may assist in therapeutic and investigational decisions. These predictive models, based on a retrospective analysis, will require validation in independent study groups. Cancer 2006. © 2006 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& METHODS The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score is a widely used and validated predictor of long-term survival in cirrhosis. The CTP score is a composite of 5 subscores, 3 based on objective clinical laboratory values and 2 subjective variables quantifying the severity of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. To date, no system to quantify CTP score from administrative databases has been validated. The Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated with Liver Disease study is a multicenter collaborative study to evaluate the outcomes and costs of hepatocellular carcinoma in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration. We developed and validated an algorithm to calculate electronic CTP (eCTP) scores by using data from the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse. METHODS Multiple algorithms for determining each CTP subscore from International Classification of Diseases version 9, Common Procedural Terminology, pharmacy, and laboratory data were devised and tested in 2 patient cohorts. For each cohort, 6 site investigators (Boston, Bronx, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and West Haven VA Medical Centers) were provided cases from which to determine validity of diagnosis, laboratory data, and clinical assessment of ascites and encephalopathy. The optimal algorithm (designated eCTP) was then applied to 30,840 cirrhotic patients alive in the first quarter of 2008 for whom 5-year overall and transplant-free survival data were available. The ability of the eCTP score and other disease severity scores (Charlson-Deyo index, Veterans Aging Cohort Study index, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and Cirrhosis Comorbidity) to predict survival was then assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS Spearman correlations for administrative and investigator validated laboratory data in the HCC and cirrhotic cohorts, respectively, were 0.85 and 0.92 for bilirubin, 0.92 and 0.87 for albumin, and 0.84 and 0.86 for international normalized ratio. In the HCC cohort, the overall eCTP score matched 96\% of patients to within 1 point of the chart-validated CTP score (Spearman correlation, 0.81). In the cirrhosis cohort, 98\% were matched to within 1 point of their actual CTP score (Spearman, 0.85). When applied to a cohort of 30,840 patients with cirrhosis, each unit change in eCTP was associated with 39\% increase in the relative risk of death or transplantation. The Harrell C statistic for the eCTP (0.678) was numerically higher than those for other disease severity indices for predicting 5-year transplant-free survival. Adding other predictive models to the eCTP resulted in minimal differences in its predictive performance. CONCLUSION We developed and validated an algorithm to extrapolate an eCTP score from data in a large administrative database with excellent correlation to actual CTP score on chart review. When applied to an administrative database, this algorithm is a highly useful predictor of survival when compared with multiple other published liver disease severity indices.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Accurate assessment of the risk of mortality following a cirrhosis-related admission can enable health-care providers to identify high-risk patients and modify treatment plans to decrease the risk of mortality. Methods We developed a post-discharge mortality prediction model for patients with a cirrhosis-related admission using a population of 314,292 patients who received care either at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) between 1992 and 2010. We extracted 68 variables from the electronic medical records (EMRs), including demographics, laboratory values, diagnosis codes, and medications. We then used a regularized logistic regression to select the most informative variables and created a risk score that comprises the selected variables. To evaluate the potential for generalizability of our score, we applied it on all cirrhosis-related admissions between 2010 and 2015 at an independent EMR data source of more than 18 million patients, pooled from different health-care systems with EMRs. We calculated the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) to assess prediction performance. Results We identified 4,781 cirrhosis-related admissions at MGH/BWH hospitals, of which 778 resulted in death within 90 days of discharge. Nine variables were the most effective predictors for 90-day mortality, and these included all MELD-Na’s components, as well as albumin, total cholesterol, white blood cell count, age, and length of stay. Applying our nine-variable risk score (denoted as “MELD-Plus”) resulted in an improvement over MELD and MELD-Na scores in several prediction models. On the MGH/BWH 90-day model, MELD-Plus improved the performance of MELD-Na by 11.4\% (0.78 [95\% CI, 0.75–0.81] versus 0.70 [95\% CI, 0.66–0.73]). In the MGH/BWH approximate 1-year model, MELD-Plus improved the performance of MELD-Na by 8.3\% (0.78 [95\% CI, 0.76–0.79] versus 0.72 [95\% CI, 0.71–0.73]). Performance improvement was similar when the novel MELD-Plus risk score was applied to an independent database; when considering 24,042 cirrhosis-related admissions, MELD-Plus improved the performance of MELD-Na by 16.9\% (0.69 [95\% CI, 0.69–0.70] versus 0.59 [95\% CI, 0.58–0.60]). Conclusions We developed a new risk score, MELD-Plus that accurately stratifies the short-term mortality of patients with established cirrhosis, following a hospital admission. Our findings demonstrate that using a small set of easily accessible structured variables can help identify novel predictors of outcomes in cirrhosis patients and improve the performance of widely used traditional risk scores.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE—We assessed whether patients with comorbid minor and major depression and type 2 diabetes had a higher mortality rate over a 3-year period compared with patients with diabetes alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—In a large health maintenance organization (HMO), 4,154 patients with type 2 diabetes were surveyed and followed for up to 3 years. Patients initially filled out a written questionnaire, and HMO-automated diagnostic, laboratory, and pharmacy data and Washington State mortality data were collected to assess diabetes complications and deaths. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios of death for each group compared with the reference group. RESULTS—There were 275 (8.3\%) deaths in 3,303 patients without depression compared with 48 (13.6\%) deaths in 354 patients with minor depression and 59 (11.9\%) deaths among 497 patients with major depression. A proportional hazards model with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment found that compared with the nondepressed group, minor depression was associated with a 1.67-fold increase in mortality (P = 0.003), and major depression was associated with a 2.30-fold increase (P {$<$} 0.0001). In a second model that controlled for multiple potential mediators, both minor and major depression remained significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS—Among patients with diabetes, both minor and major depression are strongly associated with increased mortality. Further research will be necessary to disentangle causal relationships among depression, behavioral risk factors (adherence to medical regimens), diabetes complications, and mortality.},

The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic index (PI) for acute- and lymphoma-type ATL (ATL-PI).   Patients and Methods In a retrospective review, data from 807 patients newly diagnosed with acute- and lymphoma-type ATL between January 2000 and May 2009 were evaluated. We randomly divided subjects into training (n = 404) and validation (n = 403) samples, and developed a PI using a multivariable fractional polynomial model.   Results Median overall survival time (MST) for the 807 patients was 7.7 months. The Ann Arbor stage (I and II v III and IV), performance status (0 to 1 v 2 to 4), and three continuous variables (age, serum albumin, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor [sIL-2R]) were identified as independent prognostic factors in the training sample. Using these variables, a prognostic model was devised to identify different levels of risk. In the validation sample, MSTs were 3.6, 7.3, and 16.2 months for patients at high, intermediate, and low risk, respectively (P {$<$} .001; χ2 = 89.7, 2 df; log-rank test). We also simplified the original ATL-PI according to dichotomizing age at 70 years, serum albumin at 3.5 g/dL, and sIL-2R at 20,000 U/mL and developed an easily calculable PI with prognostic discrimination power (P {$<$} .001; χ2 = 74.2, 2 df; log-rank test).   Conclusion The ATL-PI is a promising new tool for identifying patients with acute- and lymphoma-type ATL at different risks.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively examined the association between NSAID and statin use among 7042 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP, 4611) or radiotherapy (RT, 2431) for prostate cancer between 1990 and 2003 identified in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE), a primarily community-based national prostate cancer registry. We compared clinical and sociodemographic variables by statin and NSAID use, using chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regression. We examined associations between medications and comorbid illness with mortality using unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS The median (range) follow-up from treatment was 4 (0–16) years. In multivariate survival analysis, statin ‘ever-use’ was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (ACM) after RP (hazard ratio, HR, 0.35, 95\% confidence interval, CI, 0.21–0.58) and RT (0.59, 0.37–0.94). NSAID ever-use was also associated with a reduced risk of ACM after RP (HR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.30–0.75) and RT (0.39, 0.25–0.59). CONCLUSIONS In a population of men with prostate cancer, statin and NSAID ever-use were associated with a reduced risk of ACM. Our study highlights the importance of multidisciplinary survivorship care for men with prostate cancer.},

Consecutive Department of Veterans Affairs patients (aged {$>$}60 years) with AS were prospectively enrolled from 1988 to 1994 and followed until 2008 (n = 239). The baseline demographic, co-morbidity, and echocardiographic parameters were recorded. At enrollment, the mean age was 74 ± 6 years, and 78\% were men. The annualized mean aortic valve gradient progression was 4 ± 4, 6 ± 5, and 10 ± 8 mm Hg for mild, moderate, and severe AS, respectively (p {$<$}0.001). During a mean follow-up of 8 ± 5 years, 206 deaths (52\% cardiac) and 91 AVRs were recorded. The AVR/cardiac mortality event rate at 1, 5, and 10 years was 2\%, 26\%, and 50\% for mild AS, 13\%, 63\%, and 69\% for moderate AS, and 66\%, 95\%, and 95\% for severe AS (p {$<$}0.001). During the study period, 132 patients developed severe AS. The survival rate at 1, 5, and 10 years was 60 ± 7\%, 14 ± 5\%, and 5 ± 3\% with conservative management and 98 ± 2\%, 82 ± 4\%, and 50 ± 5\% after AVR, respectively (p {$<$}0.001).

In conclusion, the prognostic significance of AS is determined by the hemodynamic severity, left ventricular function, and the presence of symptoms, in the context of age and co-morbidities. The age-adjusted Charlson co-morbidity index provides crucial prognostic information to guide the surgical risk/benefit discussions for patients with severe AS.},

  abstract = {PurposeTo evaluate sex as a possible prognostic factor in bladder cancer patients treated with transurethral resection (TURBT) and radio- (RT) or radiochemotherapy (RCT).MethodsKaplan–Meier analyses and multiple Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to analyze sex as a possible prognostic factor on the overall (OS) and cancer-specific (CSS) survival of 386 male and 105 female patients who underwent TURBT and RCT or RT with curative intent between 1982 and 2007.ResultsAfter a follow-up of 5 years, female sex demonstrated a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.79 (95 \% CI 1.24–2.57) for OS; for CSS, the HR was 2.4 (95 \% CI 1.52–3.80). Sex was an adverse prognosticator of both OS and CSS independent from age at diagnosis, cT stage, grading, concurrent cis, LVI, focality, therapy response, resection status and therapy mode. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed significantly reduced OS of women compared with men, with a median survival of 2.3 years for female patients and 5.1 years for male patients (p = 0.045, log-rank test). The estimated median CSS was 7.1 years for female patients and 12.7 years for male patients (p = 0.11, log-rank test).ConclusionsFemale sex is an independent prognostic factor for reduced OS and CSS in bladder cancer patients treated by TURBT and RT or RCT. These data are in agreement with those reported for OS after radical cystectomy in muscle-invasive bladder cancers. Therefore, further studies are strongly warranted to obtain more information about molecular differences regarding sex-specific carcinogenesis in bladder cancer and about possible therapeutic considerations.},

  abstract = {Objectives We conducted a population based study aiming at finding predictors of mortality in psychotic disorders and evaluating the extent to which sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related factors explain the excess mortality. Methods In a nationally representative sample of Finns aged 30–70 years (n = 5642), psychotic disorders were diagnosed using structured interviews and medical records in 2000–2001. Information on mortality and causes of death was obtained of those who died by the end of year 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the mortality risk. Results No people with affective psychoses (n = 36) died during the follow-up, thus the analysis was restricted to non-affective psychotic disorders (NAP) (n = 106). Adjusting for age and sex, NAP was statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 2.99, 95\% CI 2.03–4.41) and natural-cause mortality (HR 2.81, 95\% CI 1.85–4.28). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health status, inflammation and smoking, the HR dropped to 2.11 (95\% CI 1.10–4.05) for all-cause and to 1.98 (95\% CI 0.94–4.16) for natural-cause mortality. Within the NAP group, antipsychotic use at baseline was associated with reduced HR for natural-cause mortality (HR 0.25, 95\% CI 0.07–0.96), and smoking with increased HR (HR 3.54, 95\% CI 1.07–11.69). Conclusions The elevated mortality risk in people with NAP is only partly explained by socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, cardio-metabolic comorbidities and inflammation. Smoking cessation should be prioritized in treatment of psychotic disorders. More research is needed on the quality of treatment of somatic diseases in people with psychotic disorders.},

During phase 1, linear regression analysis showed continuous wave Doppler to be highly accurate in predicting catheterization measured peak systolic aortic valve pressure gradients in 101 consecutive patients aged 36 to 83 years (mean 65 ± 8) with symptomatic AS. During phase 2, 90 additional patients (51 asymptomatic and 39 symptomatic) with Doppler-derived peak systolic aortic valve gradients ≥50 mm Hg (range 50 to 132 [mean 68 ± 19]) were followed for 1 to 45 months. Both groups of patients in phase 2 had similar Doppler gradients and clinical and auscuitatory evidence of moderate to severe AS at baseline. Asymptomatic patients were younger (p = 0.01), had higher ejection fractions (p = 0.001) and were less likely to have an electrocardiographic strain pattern (p = 0.01) and left atrial enlargement (p = 0.02). End-diastolic wall thickness, left ventricular cross-sectional myocardial area and estimated left ventricular mass were 18\% (p = 0.0001), 20\% (p = 0.0008), and 29\% (p = 0.002) greater in symptomatic patients. During 17 ± 9 months of follow-up, 21 asymptomatic patients (41\%) became symptomatic. Dyspnea was the most common initial complaint, occurring 2.5 and 4.8 times more often than angina and syncope, respectively. Compared with the 39 symptomatic patients, the 51 asymptomatic patients had a lower cumulative life table incidence of death from any cause (p = 0.002), and from cardiac causes (p = 0.0001) including sudden death (p = 0.013). Only 2 of the 51 initially asymptomatic patients (3.9\%) died of cardiac cause during follow-up; in both, death was preceded by the development of angina pectoris or congestive heart failure. It is concluded that asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe AS have a good prognosis during their “latent” period and are at low risk for cardiac or sudden death. These data indicate that asymptomatic patients with AS can be followed medically as long as they remain free of symptoms.},

Results Rates of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival in NASH (90\%, 88\% and 85\%, respectively) were comparable with those in non-NASH (92\%, 86\% and 80\%, respectively) patients. Mortality within 4 months of LT was twice as high in NASH as in non-NASH patients (8.5\% vs. 4.2\%; P= 0.04). Compared with non-NASH patients, post-LT mortality in NASH patients was more commonly caused by infectious (38\% vs. 26\%; P {$<$} 0.05) or cardiac (19\% vs. 7\%; P {$<$} 0.05) aetiologies. Five-year survival was lower in NASH patients with a high-risk phenotype (age {$>$}60 years, body mass index {$>$}30 kg/m2, with hypertension and diabetes) than in NASH patients without these characteristics (72\% vs. 87\%; P= 0.02).

Individuals were followed for up to 5 years (mean: 2.0 years) after their index date.Main outcome measures Rates of MI, stroke, all-cause death, and a composite of these were analyzed via Cox regression models, adjusted for covariates. Results are reported for the overall population and the subgroups of those with type 2 diabetes, additional prior MI, and non-end-stage renal disease. As a secondary endpoint healthcare costs were evaluated at baseline and during each year of follow-up.Results Over the follow-up period, which averaged 2 years, 7.6\% of all 13,492 subjects (10.5\% vs. 5.4\% with and without the selected risk factors, respectively) experienced at least one of the outcome events. The cumulative incidence rates over the entire follow-up period for the primary composite outcome were 20.8\% and 12.2\% for those with and without the selected atherothrombotic risk factors, respectively. The cardiovascular-related per-person-per-year healthcare costs during follow-up were higher in those with ≥1 additional risk factor compared to those without: \$15,247 versus \$7521. Costs were elevated over baseline costs throughout follow-up.Limitations Administrative claims data lack clinical detail. Generalizability of results is limited to the US commercially insured population of a similar age to that included in this study.Conclusions High risk MI survivors who have been event free for ≥1 year remained at substantial risk of CV events and had increased healthcare costs for up to 5 years post-MI. These long-term risks have not been previously demonstrated in a working-age US population and suggest an unmet need for continuing secondary prevention long-term post-MI.},

  abstract = {Background: In comparison with other European and North American countries, England has poor survival figures for lung cancer. Our aim was to evaluate the changes in survival since the introduction of the National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA). Methods: We used data from the NLCA to identify people with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and stratified people according to their performance status (PS) and clinical stage. Using Cox regression, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to the year of diagnosis from 2004/2005 to 2010; adjusted for patient features including age, sex and co-morbidity. We also assessed whether any changes in survival were explained by the changes in surgical resection rates or histological subtype. Results: In this cohort of 120\,745 patients, the overall median survival did not change; but there was a 1\% annual improvement in survival over the study period (adjusted HR 0.99, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–0.99). Survival improvement was only seen in patients with good PS and early stage (adjusted HR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.95–0.99) and this was partly accounted for by changes in resection rates. Conclusion: Survival has only improved for a limited group of people with NSCLC and increasing surgical resection rates appeared to explain some of this improvement.},

Aim To conduct a systematic review of the literature on accuracy and completeness of diagnostic coding in the GPRD. Design of study Systematic review. Method Six electronic databases were searched using search terms relating to the GPRD, in association with terms synonymous with validity, accuracy, concordance, and recording. A positive predictive value was calculated for each diagnosis that considered a comparison with a gold standard. Studies were also considered that compared the GPRD with other databases and national statistics. Results A total of 49 papers are included in this review. Forty papers conducted validation of a clinical diagnosis in the GPRD. When assessed against a gold standard (validation using GP questionnaire, primary care medical records, or hospital correspondence), most of the diagnoses were accurately recorded in the patient electronic record. Acute conditions were not as well recorded, with positive predictive values lower than 50\%. Twelve papers compared prevalence or consultation rates in the GPRD against other primary care databases or national statistics. Generally, there was good agreement between disease prevalence and consultation rates between the GPRD and other datasets; however, rates of diabetes and musculoskeletal conditions were underestimated in the GPRD. Conclusion Most of the diagnoses coded in the GPRD are well recorded. Researchers using the GPRD may want to consider how well the disease of interest is recorded before planning research, and consider how to optimise the identification of clinical events.},

  abstract = {Background: Sarcoidosis is a systemic, granulomatous disease of unknown origin that has variable clinical courses and affects multiple organs, including the heart (cardiac sarcoidosis, CS). It has been recently reported that isolated CS exists partly, presenting primarily cardiac symptoms, conduction disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias or left ventricular dysfunction without clinical evidence of sarcoid involvement in other organs. However, diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of CS has not been established. We aimed to investigate the utility of multiple biomarkers in CS patients.Methods and Results: We retrospectively studied plasma levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in consecutive 172 patients with diagnosed sarcoidosis. We compared these markers between non-cardiac sarcoidosis (non-CS, n=123, 71.5\%) and CS (n=49, 28.5\%) including non-isolated CS (n=30, 17.4\%) and isolated CS (n=19, 11.1\%). Level of BNP was significantly higher in CS than in non-CS (272.5 vs. 21.8 pg/ml, P=0.001). In contrast, levels of ACE, sIL-2R and cTnI did not differ between the CS and non-CS groups. From the ROC analysis, BNP (a cut off value of 40 pg/ml) identified CS with sensitivity 85.4\%, specificity 68.1\% and area under the curve 0.86 (95\% CI 0.795-0.926, P{$<$}0.001) in sarcoidosis patients. In addition, levels of ACE and sIL-2R were significantly higher in non-isolated CS than in isolated CS (ACE, 25.8 vs. 18.2 U/l, P=0.045; sIL-2R, 1170 vs. 380.5 pg/ml, P=0.038). In contrast, BNP and cTnI did not differ between non-isolated CS and isolated CS groups (BNP, 272.5 vs. 286.3 pg/ml, P=0.881; cTnI, 0.060 vs. 0.083 ng/ml, P=0.155). Furthermore, we investigated the impact of these markers on prognosis of CS. In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, only cTnI, but not ACE, IL2R or BNP, was a predictor of fatal arrhythmia in sarcoidosis patients (hazard ratio 2.418, P=0.003).Conclusion: Higher ACE and sIL2-R are associated with systemicity, whereas BNP is a useful marker to detect cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis patients. cTnI is a predictor of fatal arrhythmia in CS patients. Multiple biomarker approach supports comprehensive management of sarcoidosis.},

Ambulatory and casual blood pressure values were obtained from 1332 subjects (872 women and 460 men) aged ≥40 years from the general population of a rural Japanese community. Survival was then followed for 14 370 patient years and analyzed by a Cox hazard model adjusted for possible confounding factors. There were 72 cardiovascular deaths during the 10.8-year follow-up. The relationship between 24-hour systolic blood pressure and the cardiovascular mortality risk was U-shaped in the first 5 years, then changed to J-shaped over the rest of the 10.8-year follow-up. After censoring the first 2 years of data, the risk flattened until it again increased for the fifth quintile of 24-hour systolic blood pressure for the 10.8-year follow-up period. For 24-hour diastolic blood pressure, the J-shaped relationship remained unchanged, regardless of follow-up duration and censoring. Ambulatory systolic blood pressure values consistently showed stronger predictive power for cardiovascular mortality risk than did casual systolic blood pressure in the 10.8-year follow-up data, whereas such relationships became more marked after censoring the first 2 years. When nighttime and daytime systolic blood pressure values were simultaneously included in the same Cox model, only nighttime blood pressure significantly predicted the cardiovascular mortality risk for the 10.8-year follow-up data. We conclude that the relationship between ambulatory systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality is not U-shaped or J-shaped, and that nighttime blood pressure has better prognostic value than daytime blood pressure.},

We computed crude incidence rates, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with associated 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer, comparing statin users with nonusers. We computed HRs using Cox proportional hazards regression with statins treated as a time-varying exposure lagged by 1 year, adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status and individual comorbidities. The study included 8,311 chronic pancreatitis patients with a median age of 54 years. We observed 153 pancreatic cancers during 60,365 person-years of follow-up. The unadjusted IRR comparing statin users with nonusers was 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.60–1.60). Adjustment for potential confounders only had a small impact on the estimate (adjusted HR: 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.56–1.44). Our findings suggest that statin use is not associated with pancreatic cancer risk in patients with chronic pancreatitis.},

Enumerate patient-specific characteristics that influence clinical outcomes for older adults with AML. Formulate an algorithm to guide treatment decisions for older adults with newly-diagnosed AML. This article is available for continuing medical education credit at CME.TheOncologist.com. The incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) increases with age. Older AML patients, generally defined by age ≥60 years, have worse treatment outcomes than younger patients. While selected older patients can benefit from standard therapies, as a group they experience greater treatment-related toxicity, lower remission rates, shorter disease-free survival times, and shorter overall survival times. Outcome disparity is in part explained by age-related biologic features. Older patients are more likely to present with unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, multidrug resistance phenotypes, and secondary AML. However, even older adults with favorable tumor biology have a worse prognosis than younger patients. Patient-specific factors, including impaired physical function and comorbidity, independently predict greater treatment toxicity and shorter survival. Improving patient assessment strategies is critical to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from induction and postremission therapies. In addition, continued efforts to identify more effective and tolerable induction and postremission strategies are needed for this population. Investigations of hypomethylating agents and signal transduction inhibitors hold promise for the treatment of AML patients. Steady advances in the field of hematopoietic transplantation, including use of reduced intensity transplants, may result in additional curative options available to selected older adults. Finally, improved supportive care strategies are needed to maximize treatment outcomes.},

Methods A retrospective analysis of the United Kingdom Transplant Registry was performed (1 January 2001–31 December 2011) with patient and graft survival determined using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards models were used together with propensity-score based full matching on renal replacement therapy use. Results Three-year patient and graft survival for patients receiving renal replacement therapy were 77.7\% and 72.6\% compared with 85.1\% and 79.4\% for those not requiring renal replacement therapy (P{$<$}0.001 and P = 0.009 respectively, n = 725). In a Cox proportional hazards model, renal replacement therapy was a predictor of both patient death (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59, 95\% CI 1.01–2.50, P = 0.044) but not graft loss (HR 1.39, 95\% CI 0.92–2.10, P = 0.114). In groups fully matched on baseline covariates, those not receiving renal replacement therapy with a serum creatinine greater than 175μmol/L had a significantly worse risk of graft failure than those receiving renal replacement therapy. Conclusion In patients being transplanted for acute liver failure, use of renal replacement therapy is a strong predictor of patient death and graft loss. Those not receiving renal replacement therapy with an elevated serum creatinine may be at greater risk of early graft failure than those receiving renal replacement therapy. A low threshold for instituting renal replacement therapy may therefore be beneficial.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examines the association between lung function [percentage predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s)] and respiratory symptoms (asthma, bronchitis, wheeze, dyspnea) and mortality from all causes; coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and respiratory disease in a cohort of 2100 men and 2177 women in the Busselton Health Study followed for 20–26 years for mortality. METHODS: A total of 840 men and 637 women died during the follow-up period, and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the relationships between risk factors and mortality. RESULTS: Lung function was significantly and independently predictive of mortality from all causes, coronary heart disease, cancer, and respiratory disease in both men and women, and of mortality from stroke in women. There was evidence that, among men, the association was stronger in current and former smokers as compared to those who never smoked. After adjustment for age, smoking, lung function, coronary heart disease, blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, total cholesterol, body mass index, and alcohol consumption, dyspnea was significantly related to total mortality in men and women and to respiratory disease mortality in men, and asthma was significantly related to respiratory disease mortality in women. CONCLUSIONS: Lung function is associated with mortality from many diseases independent of smoking and respiratory symptoms. Although most respiratory symptoms are associated with smoking and lung function, after controlling for smoking and lung function, only dyspnea is associated with mortality from nonrespiratory causes.},

  abstract = {Background: we aimed to develop and validate a population-representative 10-year mortality risk index for older adults in England. Methods: data were from 10,798 men and women aged 50 years and older in the population-based English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2002/03, randomly split into development (n~=~5,377) and validation cohorts (n~=~5,421). Participants were asked about their sociodemographics, health behaviours, comorbidities, and functional status in the home-based interviews. Variables that were independently associated with all-cause mortality through March 2013 in the development cohort were weighted relative to one another to develop risk point scores for the index that was calibrated in the validation cohort. Results: the validated 10-year mortality risk index assigns points for: increasing age (50-59 years: 0 points; 60-64: 1 point; 65-69: 3 points; 70-74: 5 points; 75-79: 7 points; 80-84: 9 points; ≥85: 12 points), male (2 points), no vigorous physical activity (1 point), smoking (2 points), having a diagnosis of cancer (1 point), chronic lung disease (2 points) or heart failure (4 points), and having difficulty preparing a hot meal (2 points), pushing or pulling large objects (1 point) or walking 100 yards (1 point). In the full study cohort, 10-year mortality rates increased from 1.7\% (11/664) in those with 0 points to 95\% (189/199) among those with ≥16 points. Conclusion: this highly predictive 10-item mortality risk index is valid in the English population aged 50 years and older. It uses simple information that is often available in research studies and patient reports, and does not require biomarker data to predict mortality.},

A total of 7,001 consecutive enzyme-confirmed AMIs (6,676 patients) were screened for entry into the TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study. Medical history, echocardiographic estimation of LV systolic function determined as wall motion index, infarct complications, and survival were documented for all patients. To study the importance of congestive heart failure and wall motion index independent of age, we performed Cox proportional-hazard models in 4 different age strata (≤55 years, 56 to 65 years, 66 to 75 years, and {$>$}75 years). Patients in these strata had 1 -year mortality rates of 5\%, 11\%, 21\%, and 32\%, respectively. Three-year mortality rates were 11\%, 20\%, 34\%, and 55\%, respectively. The risk ratios (and 95\% confidence limits) associated with congestive heart failure in the same 4 age strata were 1.9 (1.3 to 2.9), 2.8 (2.1 to 3.7), 1.8 (1.5 to 2.2) and 1.8 (1.5 to 2.2), respectively. The risk ratios associated with decreasing wall motion index were 6.5 (3.6 to 11.4), 3.3 (2.3 to 4.6), 2.7 (2.2 to 3.4), and 2.1 (1.7 to 2.6), respectively. In absolute percentages, there was an excess 3-year mortality associated with congestive heart failure in the 4 age strata of 14\%, 24\%, 25\%, and 28\%, respectively. The absolute excess in 3-year mortality associated with LV systolic dysfunction in the 4 age strata was 15\%, 19\%, 25\%, and 21\%, respectively. Thus, the relative importance of LV systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure diminished with increasing age. However, the absolute excess mortality associated with congestive heart failure and LV systolic dysfunction was more pronounced in the elderly than in the young.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Body weight is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and survival, but to the authors' knowledge, the impact of long-term postdiagnostic weight change is unclear. Herein, the authors investigated whether weight change over the 5 years after a diagnosis of CRC is associated with survival. METHODS CRC cases diagnosed from 1997 to 2008 were identified through 4 population-based cancer registry sites. Participants enrolled within 2 years of diagnosis and reported their height and weight 2 years prior. Follow-up questionnaires were administered approximately 5 years after diagnosis. Associations between change in weight (in kg) or body mass index (BMI) with overall and CRC-specific survival were estimated using Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, baseline BMI, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, smoking, time between diagnosis and enrollment, and study site. RESULTS At the 5-year postdiagnostic survey, 2049 participants reported higher (53\%; median plus 5 kg), unchanged (12\%), or lower (35\%; median -4 kg) weight. Over a median of 5.1 years of subsequent follow-up (range, 0.3-9.9 years), 344 participants died (91 of CRC). Long-term weight loss (per 5 kg) was found to be associated with poorer overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.07-1.21) and CRC-specific survival (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13-1.39). Significantly lower survival was similarly observed for relative weight loss ({$>$}5\% vs ≤5\% change), BMI reduction (per 1 unit), or BMI category change (overweight to normal vs remaining overweight). CONCLUSIONS Weight loss 5 years after a diagnosis of CRC was found to be significantly associated with decreased long-term survival, suggesting the importance of avoiding weight loss in survivors of CRC. Future research should attempt to further evaluate this association, accounting for whether this weight change was intentional or represents a marker of declining health.

This study evaluates the impact of BMI on 1 year mortality in patients undergoing TAVR via the transfemoral (TF) access. METHODS: Aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVR via a TF access between May 2007 and December 2014 were categorized to 4 groups by BMI: low ({$<$}20), normal (20-24.9), overweight (25-30), and obese ({$>$}30). Baseline parameters were compared, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were generated to assess outcome differences. RESULTS: Among 491 severe AS TAVR patients, 43 had low BMI, 148 had normal BMI, 162 were overweight, and 138 were obese. Obese patients were younger with lower Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores and higher rates of preserved ejection fraction and diabetes. There was a higher rate of women in the BMI extremes. Aortic valve area was higher among obese patients; however, the indexed area was inversely correlated with BMI. Vascular complications and transfusions were more common in the low-BMI group, while acute kidney injury was more common in obese patients. All-cause mortality at 1 year was higher in the low-BMI group (log-rank p\,=\,0.003) with no significant difference among normal and above-normal BMI patients. In a multivariate model, BMI {$<$}20 kg/m(2) was an independent predictor of mortality (HR\,=\,2.45, p\,=\,0.01). CONCLUSIONS: BMI {$<$}20 kg/m(2) should be considered a frailty marker during the screening process of severe AS TAVR patients as it is associated with higher mortality, while obesity confers similar mortality risk as normal weight. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The primary endpoint was overall survival since the initiation of second-line therapy. We compared the prognostic performance of the IMDC model with the three-factor MSKCC model used for previously treated patients for overall survival since the start of second-line targeted therapy.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between Jan 1, 2005, and Nov 30, 2012, we included 1021 patients treated with second-line targeted therapy. Median overall survival since the start of second-line targeted therapy was 12·5 months (95\% CI 11·3–14·3). Five of six predefined factors in the IMDC model (anaemia, thrombocytosis, neutrophilia, Karnofsky performance status [KPS] {$<$}80, and {$<$}1 year from diagnosis to first-line targeted therapy) were independent predictors of poor overall survival on multivariable analysis. The concordance index using all six prognostic factors (ie, also including hypercalcaemia) was 0·70 (95\% CI 0·67–0·72) with the IMDC model and was 0·66 (95\% CI 0·64–0·68) with the three-factor MSKCC model. When patients were divided into three risk categories using IMDC criteria, median overall survival was 35·3 months (95\% CI 28·3–47·8) in the favourable risk group (n=76), 16·6 months (14·9–17·9) in the intermediate risk group (n=529), and 5·4 months (4·7–6·8) in the poor risk group (n=261).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The IMDC prognostic model can be applied to patients previously treated with targeted therapy, in addition to previously validated populations in first-line targeted therapy.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose— The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, recurrence, and long-term survival rates of ischemic stroke subtypes by a mechanism-based classification scheme (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment, or TOAST). Methods— We identified all 583 residents of the city of Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany, with a first ischemic stroke between 1994 and 1998. Multiple overlapping sources of information were used to ensure completeness of case ascertainment. The cause of ischemic stroke was classified according to the TOAST criteria. Patients were followed up at 3 months and 1 and 2 years after stroke onset. Results— The age-standardized incidence rates for the European population (per 100 000) regarding ischemic stroke subtypes were as follows: cardioembolism, 30.2 (95\% CI 25.6 to 35.7); small-artery occlusion, 25.8 (95\% CI 21.5 to 30.9); and large-artery atherosclerosis, 15.3 (95\% CI 12 to 19.3). When age-adjusted to the European population, the incidence rate for large-artery atherosclerosis was more than twice as high for men than for women (23.6/100 000 versus 9.2/100 000). Two years after onset, patients in the small-artery occlusion subgroup were 3 times more likely to be alive than those with cardioembolism. Ischemic stroke subtype according to the TOAST criteria was a significant predictor for long-term survival, whereas subtype was not a significant predictor of long-term recurrence up to 2 years, both before and after adjustment for age and sex. Conclusions— Epidemiological observational studies that possess wide access to appropriate diagnostic technologies and apply standardized etiologic classifications provide a much better understanding of underlying risk factors for initial stroke, recurrence, and mortality.},

Patients on dialysis, who suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be biased by population heterogeneity. Methods Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models that allow individual variation in this increase. Results According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis, while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant. Conclusions Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.},

  abstract = {The most frequently used model to describe the exponential increase in mortality rate over age is the Gompertz equation. Logarithmically transformed, the equation conforms to a straight line, of which the slope has been interpreted as the rate of senescence. Earlier, we proposed the derivative function of the Gompertz equation as a superior descriptor of senescence rate. Here, we tested both measures of the rate of senescence in a population of patients with end-stage renal disease. It is clinical dogma that patients on dialysis experience accelerated senescence, whereas those with a functional kidney transplant have mortality rates comparable to the general population. Therefore, we calculated the age-specific mortality rates for European patients on dialysis (n=274 221; follow-up=594 767 person-years), for European patients with a functioning kidney transplant (n=61 286; follow-up=345 024 person-years), and for the general European population. We found higher mortality rates, but a smaller slope of logarithmic mortality curve for patients on dialysis compared with both patients with a functioning kidney transplant and the general population (P{$<$}0.001). A classical interpretation of the Gompertz model would imply that the rate of senescence in patients on dialysis is lower than in patients with a functioning transplant and lower than in the general population. In contrast, the derivative function of the Gompertz equation yielded the highest senescence rates for patients on dialysis, whereas the rate was similar in patients with a functioning transplant and the general population. We conclude that the rate of senescence is better described by the derivative function of the Gompertz equation.},

  abstract = {Objective We evaluated survival outcomes of partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN) for clinical T2 renal masses (cT2RM) controlling for R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score. Patients and Methods A two-centre study comprised of 202 patients with cT2RM who underwent RN (122) or PN (80) between July 2002 and June 2012 (median follow-up 41.5 months). Kaplan−Meier analysis compared overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among the entire cohort and within categories of R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score of ≥10 and {$<$}10. Association between procedure and PFS and OS was analysed using Cox-proportional hazard. Results There were no significant differences between PN and RN in clinical T stage and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores. For RN and PN, the 5-year PFS was 69.8\% and 79.9\% (P = 0.115), CSS was 82.5\% and 86.7\% (P = 0.407), and OS was 80\% and 83.3\% (P = 0.291). Cox regression showed no association between RN vs PN and PFS; a R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score of ≥10 was associated with a shorter PFS (hazard ratio 6.69, P = 0.002). Kaplan–Meier analysis for RN vs PN showed no difference in PFS for entire cohort or within the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score categories of ≥10 and {$<$}10. The PFS was better for those with R.E.N.A.L nephrometry scores of {$<$}10 vs ≥10 (P {$<$} 0.001) and for cT2a vs cT2b tumours (P = 0.012). OS was no different between cT2a and cT2b tumours; patients with R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores of ≥10 were more likely to die from disease (P {$<$} 0.001) or any cause (P {$<$} 0.001) vs those with R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores of {$<$}10. Conclusions PN may be oncologically effective for cT2RM. A R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score of ≥10 is negatively associated with OS among cT2RM compared with a score of {$<$}10 and provides additional risk assessment beyond clinical T stage. Further follow-up and prospective randomised investigation is requisite to confirm efficacy of PN for cT2RM.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term, cause-specific mortality rates and rate ratios of the patients alive at 1 year after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: The population-based, prospective, cohort study with a nested case-control design consisted of 64,349 persons (aged 25-74 years at enrollment) who participated in the National FINRISK Study between 1972 and 2007. Four hundred thirty-seven SAH cases, 233 one-year SAH survivors, and their matched intrinsic controls were identified and followed up until the end of 2009 through the nationwide Finnish Causes of Death Register. All-cause mortality rates and rate ratios of the 1-year SAH survivors and controls were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Eighty-eight (37.8\%) of 233 one-year SAH survivors died during the total follow-up time of 2,487 person-years (median 8.6 years, range 0.1-35.8 years). The 1-year SAH survivors had a hazard ratio of 1.96 (95\% confidence interval 1.57-2.47) for death compared with the matched general population with 10 controls for each SAH survivor. One-year SAH survivors had up to 31 additional deaths per 1,000 person-years compared with controls with minimal cerebrovascular risk factors. The higher long-term risk of death among SAH survivors was attributed solely to cerebrovascular diseases, and most important modifiable risk factors for death were smoking, high systolic blood pressure (≥ 159 mm Hg), and high cholesterol levels (≥ 7.07 mmol/L). CONCLUSION: One-year SAH survivors have excess mortality, which is attributed to an exceptional risk of deadly cerebrovascular events. Aggressive post-SAH cerebrovascular risk factor intervention strategies are highly warranted.},

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study from 1999 to 2013, we assessed the association between cessation during the first year after diagnosis and all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Results: Of 2882 lung, 757 upper aero-digestive tract (UAT) and 1733 bladder cancer patients 27\%, 29\% and 21\% of lung, UAT and bladder cancer patients quit smoking. In lung cancer patients that quit, all-cause mortality was significantly lower (HR: 0.82 (0.74–0.92), while cancer-specific mortality (HR: 0.89 (0.76–1.04) and death due to index cancer (HR: 0.90 (0.77–1.05) were non-significantly lower. In UAT cancer, all-cause mortality (HR: 0.81 (0.58–1.14), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 0.84 (0.48–1.45), and death due to index cancer (HR: 0.75 (0.42–1.34) were non-significantly lower. There was no evidence of an association between quitting and mortality in bladder cancer. The HRs were 1.02 (0.81–1.30) for all-cause, 1.23 (0.81–1.86) for cancer specific, and 1.25 (0.71–2.20) for death due to index cancer. These showed a non-significantly lower risk in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: People with lung and possibly UAT cancer who quit smoking have a lower risk of mortality than people who continue smoking.},

With many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) available as treatment options for CML, the influence of TKI therapy on OS is difficult to define. Comorbidities can complicate randomized trials. Their influence on OS in CML has not been studied so far. Aims We sought to evaluate the influence of comorbidities at diagnosis of CML on remission rates and OS of patients with Philadelphia and/or BCR-ABL positive chronic-phase CML. The CML-Study IV, a randomized five-arm trial designed to optimize imatinib therapy alone or in combination, used very few exclusion criteria as compared to other studies which typically excluded patients with severe illnesses. Methods The age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is the most extensively studied comorbidity index (Charlson ME et al., 1987) and has been validated for long-term studies. The score weighs a) the severity of comorbidities (e.g. one point is allocated to myocardial infarction and diabetes, two points to non-active malignancies) and b) the age of patients (with one point for each decade above 40 years). The CCI at diagnosis was calculated for each randomized patient. For the analyses, patients were grouped into CCI 2, 3-4, 5-6, and ≥7. Performance status was measured by the Karnofsky Score (KS) and patients were grouped into 50-80, {$>$}80-{$<$}100, and 100. Correlation analyses were performed by the chi-square test. Survival probabilities were calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves. Calculating cumulative incidences, the competing risks progression and/or death were considered. Cox models were estimated for the multivariate analysis to analyse the prognostic influence of the candidate factors age, sex, leukocytes, hemoglobin, EUTOS score, KS, and CCI on OS. Results 1551 patients were randomized from 2002 to 2012, 1524 patients were evaluable. Median follow-up time was 67.5 months. Additional to CML, 521 index comorbidities were reported in 1519 patients resulting in the following CCI groups: i) CCI 2: 589 patients, ii) CCI 3 or 4: 599 patients, iii) CCI 5 or 6: 229 patients, and iv) CCI ≥ 7: 102 patients. Median value of the CCI was 3 (range: 2-12). The distribution of the CCI groups was not different between treatment arms. Most common comorbidities were diabetes (n=106), non-active cancer (n=102), chronic pulmonary disease (n=74), renal insufficiency (n=47), myocardial infarction (n=38), cerebrovascular disease (n=29), congestive heart failure (n=28), and peripheral vascular disease (n=28).Between patients with CCI 2, 3-4, 5-6, and ≥7 no significant differences in remission rates were found neither for time to complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) nor for time to major molecular remission (MMR). Median times to CCR were 12.9, 12.6, 13.7, and 13.1 months and to MMR 17.5, 15.9, 16.5, and 18.1 months, respectively. No differences were observed between the CCI groups for the cumulative incidences of progression. As expected, significant differences in OS according to CCI at diagnosis were observed (s. Fig. 1, p{$<$}0.001). Probabilities of OS at 8 years for patients with CCI 2, 3-4, 5-6, and ≥7 were 93.6\%, 89.4\%, 78.7\%, and 45.2\%.{$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure 1" src="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/122/21/91/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="313"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1 Overall survival according to Charlson index at diagnosisWe found a correlation between CCI and KS (p{$<$}0.001). In multivariate analysis CCI (p{$<$}0.001), KS (p=0.022), and EUTOS Score (p=0.012) were significant predictors of OS. Hazard ratios for the CCI group 3-4, 5-6, {$>$}7 (each vs. 2), were 1.695 (95\%-confidence interval, CI 1.066-2.695), 3.231 (CI 1.942-5.376) and 6.495 (CI 3.817-11.111), respectively. Separating the CCI into an age-related part and a comorbidity-related part, the comorbidity-related part was still an important risk factor (Wald test, p=0.002). Conclusions Comorbidities of CML-patients do not seem to have an impact on the success of imatinib treatment. In CML-Study IV, even patients with a considerable comorbidity benefitted from imatinib as the chances to achieve MMR and CCR did not differ from those of healthier CML-patients. Our data also indicate that OS alone is not any more an appropriate measure for the effectiveness of a specific treatment for CML, as TKI have reduced the CML-related lethality to too low levels. Adjusting for comorbidity is essential for a valid comparison and interpretation of OS observed with different TKIs in CML-patients.

Design~Register study included all Danish women who underwent surgery for uterine cancer or atypical endometrial hyperplasia (International Classification of Diseases-10 codes D070, DC549) 2005 to 2012 (n = 6003).         Main Outcome Measures~Impact of BMI on type I and II endometrial cancer survival.         Materials and Methods~Danish Gynecological Cancer Database data on women with type I and II endometrial cancer were retrieved. Kaplan-Meier plot was used to illustrate differences in survival in relation to BMI. Log-rank test was used to demonstrate difference between the curves. Cox regression hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of the effect of BMI on overall survival.         Results~Four thousand three hundred thirty women were included. Women with type I cancer had a significantly better overall survival compared with those with type II cancer. Low BMI was associated with increased mortality in type I (HR, 2.07; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–3.55), whereas in type II both low (HR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.03–2.74) and high BMI (BMI, 30–35: HR, 1.54; 95\% CI, 1.01–2.26 and BMI {$>$}40: HR, 2.15; 95\% CI, 1.12–4.11) were significantly associated with increased mortality.         Conclusion~Abnormal BMI is associated with increased mortality in subtypes of endometrial cancer. Underweight was associated with increased overall mortality in both types I and II, whereas obesity only disclosed a significant impact on overall mortality in type II.},

No studies assess mortality in patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis.AimCompare mortality in patients with cirrhosis on statins to those not on statins.MethodsA retrospective cohort study evaluated patients from 1988 to 2011 at Partners Healthcare Hospitals. The Partners Research Patient Data Registry identified patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis on statins at biopsy and at least 3 months following. Controls were matched 1:2 by age, gender and Child–Pugh class. Decompensation was defined as ascites, jaundice/bilirubin {$>$}2.5 mg/dL, and/or hepatic encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcome was decompensation in baseline-compensated patients. Chi-square and two-way ANOVA testing compared groups. Cox proportional hazards models for mortality controlled for age, Child–Pugh class, diabetes, coronary artery disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Kaplan–Meier curves graphed mortality.ResultsEighty-one statin users and 162 controls were included. Median follow-up: 36 months in statin users and 30 months in controls. 70.4 \% of patients were Child–Pugh A. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), albumin, varices and beta-blocker use were not significantly different between groups. Statin users had lower mortality on multivariate analysis (HR 0.53, p = 0.01), and Child–Pugh A patients had longer survival on Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox multivariate analysis for decompensation showed lower risk of decompensation with statins while increased decompensation with low albumin, high MELD score and beta-blocker use.ConclusionsIn patients with cirrhosis, statin therapy is not associated with increased mortality and may delay decompensation.},

  abstract = {Purpose Multiple risks compete with cancer as the primary cause of death. These factors must be considered against the benefits of treatment. We constructed a competing causes of death model to help contextualize treatment tradeoff analyses in patients with localized RCC. Patients and Methods 6,655 individuals ≥66 years old with localized RCC were identified in the linked SEER Medicare dataset (1995–2005). We used Fine and Gray’s competing risks proportional hazards regressions to predict probabilities of competing mortality outcomes. Prognostic markers included race, gender, tumor size, age, and the CCI Score. Results After a median follow-up of 43 months, age and comorbidity score strongly correlated to patient mortality and were most predictive of non-kidney cancer deaths as measured by concordance statistics. We demonstrate that patients with localized node negative kidney cancer have low 3 (4.7\%), 5 (7.5\%) and 10 (11.9\%) year probabilities of cancer specific death, but significantly higher overall risk of death from competing causes within 3 (10.9\%), 5 (20.1\%) and 10 (44.4\%) years of diagnosis of RCC, depending on their comorbidity scores. Conclusions Informed treatment decisions regarding patients with solid tumors must integrate not only cancer-related variables, but also factors that predict for non-cancer death. Here we establish a comorbidity based predictive model, which may assist in patient counseling by allowing quantification and comparison of competing risks of death in patients 66 and older with localized RCC who choose to proceed with surgery.},

We conducted a prospective investigation of pre-diagnosis body mass index (BMI) and mortality among 14,948 breast cancer patients in the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project. Breast cancer patients diagnosed from 1990-2006 with AJCC Stage I-III breast tumors were drawn from four prospective cohorts. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) representing the associations of BMI categories (World Health Organization international classifications) with recurrence and mortality were estimated using delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models. Obese (30-{$<$}35 kg/m2), severely obese (35-{$<$}40 kg/m2), and morbidly obese (≥40 kg/m2) were examined. After a mean follow-up of 7.8 years, 2,140 deaths and 2,065 recurrences were documented. Both underweight (HR=1.59; 95\% CI: 1.18, 2.13) and morbidly obese women (HR=1.81; 95\% CI: 1.42, 2.32) had the greatest risk of overall mortality compared to normal-weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) women. Severe obesity (HR=1.09; 95\% CI: 0.88, 1.36) and obesity (HR=1.11; 95\% CI: 0.97, 1.27) were related to small, non-significant increased risks. Overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2) was not associated with any excess risk compared to normal weight. Similar associations were found for breast cancer death and non-breast cancer death but not recurrence. Women who were underweight and morbidly obese before breast cancer diagnosis were at the greatest risk of all-cause mortality. Morbidly obese women were also at increased risk of death from breast cancer. These results suggest that degree of obesity confers differential risk on survival.},

The association of body mass index at surgery with clinicopathological features was examined, and the prognostic value of body mass index for recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific survival was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox regression models. Additional survival analyses were carried out in a subgroup of 534 patients with N0M0 disease. Results Of 714 patients, 304 (42.6\%), 184 (25.8\%) and 226 (31.7\%) had a body mass index of {$<$}23 (normal), 23–25 (overweight), and ≥25 (obese) kg/m2, respectively. Patients with high body mass index had a lower pathological T stage, fewer lymph node metastases and a lower frequency of lymphovascular invasion than those with low body mass index (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Multivariable analysis showed that obese status was an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival (obese vs normal: P\,{$<$}\,0.001; overweight vs normal: P\,=\,0.008) and cancer-specific survival (obese vs normal: P\,{$<$}\,0.001; overweight vs normal: P\,=\,0.019), along with pathological T stage, lymph node metastasis, and lymphovascular invasion. In addition, obesity was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (P\,=\,0.018) and cancer-specific survival (P\,=\,0.019) in patients with N0M0 status. Conclusions The present findings suggest that overweight and obesity are associated with favorable pathological features and prognosis in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Stroke mortality has been declining since the early 20th century. The reasons for this are not completely understood, although the decline is welcome. As a result of recent striking and more accelerated decreases in stroke mortality, stroke has fallen from the third to the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. This has prompted a detailed assessment of the factors associated with the change in stroke risk and mortality. This statement considers the evidence for factors that have contributed to the decline and how they can be used in the design of future interventions for this major public health burden. Methods—Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair and co-chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council’s Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writers used systematic literature reviews, references to published clinical and epidemiological studies, morbidity and mortality reports, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize evidence and to indicate gaps in current knowledge. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on this document and approved the final version. The document underwent extensive American Heart Association internal peer review, Stroke Council leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. Results—The decline in stroke mortality over the past decades represents a major improvement in population health and is observed for both sexes and for all racial/ethnic and age groups. In addition to the overall impact on fewer lives lost to stroke, the major decline in stroke mortality seen among people {$<$}65 years of age represents a reduction in years of potential life lost. The decline in mortality results from reduced incidence of stroke and lower case-fatality rates. These significant improvements in stroke outcomes are concurrent with cardiovascular risk factor control interventions. Although it is difficult to calculate specific attributable risk estimates, efforts in hypertension control initiated in the 1970s appear to have had the most substantial influence on the accelerated decline in stroke mortality. Although implemented later, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia control and smoking cessation programs, particularly in combination with treatment of hypertension, also appear to have contributed to the decline in stroke mortality. The potential effects of telemedicine and stroke systems of care appear to be strong but have not been in place long enough to indicate their influence on the decline. Other factors had probable effects, but additional studies are needed to determine their contributions. Conclusions—The decline in stroke mortality is real and represents a major public health and clinical medicine success story. The repositioning of stroke from third to fourth leading cause of death is the result of true mortality decline and not an increase in mortality from chronic lung disease, which is now the third leading cause of death in the United States. There is strong evidence that the decline can be attributed to a combination of interventions and programs based on scientific findings and implemented with the purpose of reducing stroke risks, the most likely being improved control of hypertension. Thus, research studies and the application of their findings in developing intervention programs have improved the health of the population. The continued application of aggressive evidence-based public health programs and clinical interventions is expected to result in further declines in stroke mortality.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Few data exist on predictors of long-term prognosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Most studies have only assessed short-term prognosis in patients with advanced ALD. We aimed to assess the prognostic impact of clinical, biochemical and histological parameters on long-term prognosis in patients with early/compensated and decompensated ALD. Methods Consecutive patients (n=192) with biopsy-proven liver disease due to alcohol abuse were analyzed retrospectively. Prognostic factors were evaluated in patients with early/compensated ALD (n=60) and in patients with decompensated ALD (clinical decompensation and/or bilirubin {$>$}3mg/dl at entry) (n=132). Factors that predict long-term survival were identified using Cox regression models. Results Liver-related mortality at 5years was 13\% in early/compensated and 43\% in decompensated ALD. In early/compensated ALD patients, long-term prognosis was determined by fibrosis stage, but not by clinical or biochemical variables. Severe fibrosis (F3/4) was present in 52\% and had a major impact on 10-year mortality (F3/4: 45\% vs. F0-2: 0\%, p{$<$}0.001). In contrast, in decompensated patients, a combination of clinical features (sex), biochemical markers of liver failure (bilirubin, international normalized ratio [INR]), and histological features (pericellular fibrosis) predicted long-term survival. During follow-up, abstinence from alcohol was an important predictor of survival in both early/compensated and decompensated ALD. Conclusion Fibrosis stage is the main predictor of long-term survival in patients with early/compensated ALD, while clinical, biochemical and histological parameters predict survival in patients with decompensated disease. Promoting abstinence may improve survival in patients with both early and advanced ALD. Lay summary In this study, we evaluated long-term outcome in 192 patients with alcoholic liver disease who underwent liver biopsy: 60 patients with early disease (no symptoms) and 132 patients with advanced disease (jaundice, complications of cirrhosis). Importantly, half of the patients with ‘early’ disease already had severe fibrosis or cirrhosis on liver histology and dismal outcome (45\% mortality at 10years). Abstinence from alcohol improved the prognosis in both early and advanced stages of the disease.},

  abstract = {Background Mental symptoms are prevalent among populations, but their associations with premature mortality are inadequately understood. We examined whether mental symptoms contribute to cause-specific mortality among midlife employees, while considering key covariates. Methods Baseline mail survey data from 2000–02 included employees, aged 40–60, of the City of Helsinki, Finland (n\,=\,8960, 80~\% women, response rate 67~\%). Mental symptoms were measured by the General Health Questionnaire 12-item version (GHQ-12) and the Short Form 36 mental component summary (MCS). Covariates included sex, marital status, social support, health behaviours, occupational social class and limiting long-standing illness. Causes of death by the end of 2013 were obtained from Statistics Finland (n\,=\,242) and linked individually to survey data pending consent (n\,=\,6605). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95~\% confidence intervals (95~\% CI) were calculated using Cox regression analysis. Results For all-cause mortality, only MCS showed a weak association before adjustments. For natural mortality, no associations were found. For unnatural mortality (n\,=\,21), there was a sex adjusted association with GHQ (HR\,=\,1.96, 95~\% CI\,=\,1.45–2.64) and MCS (2.30, 95~\% CI\,=\,1.72–3.08). Among unnatural causes of death suicidal mortality (n\,=\,11) was associated with both GHQ (2.20, 95~\% CI\,=\,1.47–3.29) and MCS (2.68, 95~\% CI\,=\,1.80–3.99). Of the covariates limiting long-standing illness modestly attenuated the associations. Conclusions Two established measures of mental symptoms, i.e. GHQ-12 and SF-36 MCS, were both associated with subsequent unnatural, i.e. accidental and violent, as well as suicidal mortality. No associations were found for natural mortality due to diseases. These findings need to be corroborated in further populations. Supporting mental health through workplace measures may help counteract subsequent suicidal and other unnatural mortality among midlife employees.},

Objective To assess the association between midlife CRF and incident cancer and survival following a cancer diagnosis. Design Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting Preventive medicine clinic Participants and Exposures The prospective, observational cohort study included 13,949 community-dwelling men who had a baseline fitness examination. All men completed a comprehensive medical examination, a cardiovascular risk factor assessment, and incremental treadmill exercise test to evaluate CRF. We utilized age-sex specific distribution of treadmill duration from the overall CCLS population to define fitness groups as low (lowest 20\%), moderate (middle 40\%), and high (upper 40\%) fit groups. The adjusted multivariable model included: age, exam year, body mass index, smoking, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, fasting glucose. Main Outcome Measures (1) Incident prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer, and (2) all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality among men who developed cancer are Medicare age (on or after age 65 years). Results Compared to low CRF, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer among men with high CRF was 0.45 (95\% CI: 0.29-0.68), 0.56 (95\% CI: 0.36-0.87), 1.22 (95\% CI: 1.02-1.46), respectively. Among those diagnosed with cancer at Medicare age (65 years), high CRF in mid-life was associated with an adjusted 36\% (HR 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.45-0.93) risk reduction in all cancer related deaths and a 69\% reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality following a cancer diagnosis (HR 0.31, 95\% CI: 0.15-0.62) compared to low fit men in mid-life. Conclusions and Relevance There is a strong inverse relationship between midlife CRF and incident lung and colorectal cancer but not prostate cancer. High mid-life CRF is also protective against the risk of cause-specific mortality in those diagnosed with cancer at Medicare age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dual-chamber (atrioventricular) and single-chamber (ventricular) pacing are alternative treatment approaches for sinus-node dysfunction that causes clinically significant bradycardia. However, it is unknown which type of pacing results in the better outcome. METHODS: We randomly assigned a total of 2010 patients with sinus-node dysfunction to dual-chamber pacing (1014 patients) or ventricular pacing (996 patients) and followed them for a median of 33.1 months. The primary end point was death from any cause or nonfatal stroke. Secondary end points included the composite of death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure; atrial fibrillation; heart-failure score; the pacemaker syndrome; and the quality of life. RESULTS: The incidence of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the dual-chamber group (21.5 percent) and the ventricular-paced group (23.0 percent, P=0.48). In patients assigned to dual-chamber pacing, the risk of atrial fibrillation was lower (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P=0.008), and heart-failure scores were better (P{$<$}0.001). The differences in the rates of hospitalization for heart failure and of death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure were not significant in unadjusted analyses but became marginally significant in adjusted analyses. Dual-chamber pacing resulted in a small but measurable increase in the quality of life, as compared with ventricular pacing. CONCLUSIONS: In sinus-node dysfunction, dual-chamber pacing does not improve stroke-free survival, as compared with ventricular pacing. However, dual-chamber pacing reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, reduces signs and symptoms of heart failure, and slightly improves the quality of life. Overall, dual-chamber pacing offers significant improvement as compared with ventricular pacing.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Approaches to risk stratification for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are limited, single-center based, and often dichotomous. We aimed to develop and validate a better model for determining prognoses of patients with PBC. Methods We performed an international, multicenter meta-analysis of 4119 patients with PBC treated with ursodeoxycholic acid at liver centers in 8 European and North American countries. Patients were randomly assigned to derivation (n~= 2488 [60\%]) and validation cohorts (n~= 1631 [40\%]). A risk score (GLOBE score) to predict transplantation-free survival was developed and validated with univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses using clinical and biochemical variables obtained after 1 year of ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. Risk score outcomes were compared with the survival of age-, sex-, and calendar time-matched members of the general population. The prognostic ability of the GLOBE score was evaluated alongside those of the Barcelona, Paris-1, Rotterdam, Toronto, and Paris-2 criteria. Results Age (hazard ratio~= 1.05; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04−1.06; P {$<$} .0001); levels of bilirubin (hazard ratio~= 2.56; 95\% CI: 2.22−2.95; P {$<$} .0001), albumin (hazard ratio~= 0.10; 95\% CI: 0.05−0.24; P {$<$} .0001), and alkaline phosphatase (hazard ratio~= 1.40; 95\% CI: 1.18−1.67; P~= .0002); and platelet count (hazard ratio/10 units decrease = 0.97; 95\% CI: 0.96−0.99; P {$<$} .0001) were all independently associated with death or liver transplantation (C-statistic derivation, 0.81; 95\% CI: 0.79−0.83, and validation cohort, 0.82; 95\% CI: 0.79−0.84). Patients with risk scores {$>$}0.30 had significantly shorter times of transplant-free survival than matched healthy individuals (P~{$<~$}.0001). The GLOBE score identified patients who would survive for 5 years and 10 years (responders) with positive predictive values of 98\% and 88\%, respectively. Up to 22\% and 21\%~of events and nonevents, respectively, 10 years after initiation of treatment were correctly reclassified in comparison with earlier proposed criteria. In subgroups of patients aged {$<$}45, 45−52, 52−58, 58−66, and ≥66 years, age-specific GLOBE-score thresholds beyond which survival~significantly deviated from matched healthy individuals were~−0.52, 0.01, 0.60, 1.01 and 1.69, respectively. Transplant-free survival could still be accurately calculated by the GLOBE score with~laboratory values collected at 2−5 years after treatment. Conclusions We developed and validated scoring system (the GLOBE score) to predict transplant-free survival of ursodeoxycholic acid−treated patients with PBC. This score might be used to select strategies for treatment and care.},

This substudy aimed to define the clinical outcomes and patient characteristics associated with statin nonprescription after STEMI. We compared clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics and in-hospital, 30-day, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year outcomes in 3,512 patients discharged after STEMI with and without (6\%) statin prescriptions in the harmonizing outcomes with revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00433966). Statin nonprescription was associated with female sex, nonwhite race, previous bypass surgery, heart failure, renal impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, care in the United States, lower prescription rates of antiplatelets and neurohormonal antagonists, less percutaneous coronary intervention and stents, and, in 26\% of cases, angiographically normal or nonobstructed coronary arteries. At every time point of follow-up after discharge, patients with no discharge statin prescription had significantly higher rates of net adverse clinical events, major adverse cardiac events, major bleeding unrelated to bypass surgery, and death. After multivariable adjustment, absence of a discharge statin prescription independently predicted 3-year major adverse cardiac event (hazard ratio 1.54, 95\% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.07, p~= 0.0037) and death (hazard ratio 2.30, 95\% confidence interval 1.41 to 3.77, p~= 0.0009). In conclusion, within the framework of this randomized trial of patients presenting with STEMI, approximately 6\% of patients were discharged without statin therapy.

In this work, we examined whether postdiagnosis statin use was associated with reduced cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality among patients with prostate cancer in Denmark.Material and MethodsFrom nationwide Danish registries, we identified all patients with incident prostate adenocarcinoma from 1998 to 2011 and retrieved data on tumor and patient characteristics, drug use, and primary treatment. We defined postdiagnosis use (two or more prescriptions) of statins as a time-varying covariate with 1-year lag. Cox proportional hazards regression models used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for prostate cancer–specific mortality and all-cause mortality through 2013 associated with postdiagnosis statin use. In secondary and sensitivity analyses, we assessed statin use within exposure periods of 1 year or 5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis and evaluated the influence of prediagnosis statin use.ResultsAmong 31,790 patients, 7,365 died of prostate cancer and 11,811 died from other causes during a median follow-up of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.3 to 5.1 years) from 1 year after diagnosis. Postdiagnosis statin use was associated with adjusted HRs of 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.77 to 0.89) for prostate cancer mortality and 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.76 to 0.85) for all-cause mortality. Similar results were observed in 1-year and 5-year sensitivity analyses. No substantial effect measure modification was found with estimated dose or type of statin, clinical stage, Gleason score, or with prediagnosis statin use; however, patients who were diagnosed early in the study period or who underwent radical prostatectomy or endocrine therapy exhibited slightly lower HRs for prostate cancer mortality with postdiagnosis statin use than did those in the overall analyses.ConclusionPostdiagnosis statin use was associated with reduced mortality from prostate cancer; however, it remains to be established whether this association is causal.},

MEASUREMENTS: Baseline measurements included patient demographic features, Mini-Mental State Examination score, Blessed Dementia Rating Scale score, duration since reported onset of symptoms, associated symptoms, comorbid conditions, and selected signs. Survival was the outcome of interest. RESULTS: The median survival from initial diagnosis was 4.2 years for men and 5.7 years for women with Alzheimer disease. Men had poorer survival across all age groups compared with females. Survival was decreased in all age groups compared with the life expectancy of the U.S. population. Predictors of mortality based on proportional hazards models included a baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score of 17 or less, baseline Blessed Dementia Rating Scale score of 5.0 or greater, presence of frontal lobe release signs, presence of extrapyramidal signs, gait disturbance, history of falls, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes at baseline. LIMITATIONS: The base population, although typical of the surrounding Seattle community, may not be representative of other, more diverse populations. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of community-dwelling elderly persons who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, survival duration was shorter than predicted on the basis of U.S. population data, especially for persons with onset at relatively younger ages. Features significantly associated with reduced survival at diagnosis were increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, physical examination findings of frontal release signs, and abnormal gait. The variables most strongly associated with survival were measures of disease severity at the time of diagnosis. These results should be useful to patients and families experiencing Alzheimer disease, other caregivers, clinicians, and policymakers when planning for future care needs.},

  abstract = {Aims To analyze the five-year mortality after hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF) and compare predictors of prognosis in patients with and without a previous history of heart failure. Methods Patients with AHF (n=620) from the prospective multicenter FINN-AKVA study were classified as acutely decompensated chronic heart failure (ADCHF) or de-novo AHF if no previous history of heart failure was present. Both all-cause mortality during five years of follow-up and prognostic factors were determined. Results The overall mortality was 60.3\% (n=374) at five years. ADCHF was associated with significantly poorer outcome compared to de-novo AHF; five-year mortality rate 75.6\% vs. 44.4\% (p{$<$}0.001). Initially, mortality was high (33.5\% in ADCHF and 21.7\% in de-novo AHF after 12months), but in de-novo AHF the annual mortality declined markedly already after the first year. Compared to de-novo AHF, patients with ADCHF had an increased risk of death for several years after the index hospitalization. A previous history of heart failure was an independent predictor of five-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.8 (95\% CI 1.4–2.2; p{$<$}0.001). Older age and impaired renal function were associated with adverse long-term prognosis in both ADCHF and de-novo AHF, while higher systolic blood pressure on admission predicted better outcome. Conclusion The long-term prognosis after hospitalization for AHF is poor, with a significantly different survival observed in patients with de-novo AHF compared to ADCHF. A previous history of heart failure is an independent predictor of five-year mortality. Distinction between ADCHF and de-novo AHF may improve our understanding of patients with AHF.},

Methods and Results We assessed the impact of age on the prognostic value of body mass index (BMI) in 1268 consecutive STEMI patients admitted to our Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU). BMI categories were as follows: 37 “lean” patients (37/1268, 2.9\%), 403 “normal” patients (403/1268, 31.8\%), 656 “overweight” patients (656/1268, 51.7\%), 172 “obese” patients (172/1268, 13.6\%). Among patients aged {$<$}75 years, as BMI increased, the number of males and diabetic patients significantly increased (p~{$<~$}0.001 and p~=~0.004, respectively). Among STEMI patients aged ≥75 years, lean patients showed a higher in-ICCU mortality in respect to the other BMI categories but this did not reach statistical significance. BMI was an independent predictor of In-ICCU mortality in the whole population (lean vs. “normal”: OR 3.47, 95\%CI 1.08–11.14, p~=~0.036) and it was associated with long term mortality only in patients {$<$}75 years since lean and overweight patients showed lower survival rate (lean vs. “normal”: HR 9.25, 95\%CI 3.09–27.63, p~{$<~$}0.001; overweight vs. “normal”: OR 2.10; 95\%CI 1.04–4.23, p~=~0.039). Conclusions In our series, underweight is associated with the highest mortality across all age subgroups, while only in patients {$<$}75 years, overweight patients showed increased in-hospital mortality rate and a poorer long term survival rate. According to our data, the “so called obesity paradox” should be probably age-contextualized.},

It has therefore been concluded that treatment and prevention of such changes in old age should increase healthspan and delay death. However, accruing epidemiological and clinical trial evidence in older humans suggests that this is not the case. Some studies have shown that antioxidants and hormone supplements increase mortality, whereas high blood pressure, obesity, and metabolic syndrome are often associated with improved outcomes in very elderly people. Perhaps, some of these supposedly detrimental changes accompanying old age are in fact evolutionary adaptations to prolong life after reproduction in humans. Indeed, a form of reverse antagonistic pleiotropy or adaptive senectitude might be occurring. Some common biological and medical changes in old age might actually enhance longevity and represent novel targets for improving health in older people.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Both comorbid conditions and functional measures predict mortality in older adults, but few prognostic indexes combine both classes of predictors. Combining easily obtained measures into an accurate predictive model could be useful to clinicians advising patients, as well as policy makers and epidemiologists interested in risk adjustment. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prognostic index for 4-year mortality using information that can be obtained from patient report. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the 1998 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-based study of community-dwelling US adults older than 50 years, we developed the prognostic index from 11,701 individuals and validated the index with 8009. Individuals were asked about their demographic characteristics, whether they had specific diseases, and whether they had difficulty with a series of functional measures. We identified variables independently associated with mortality and weighted the variables to create a risk index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death by December 31, 2002. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 81\%. During the 4-year follow-up, there were 1361 deaths (12\%) in the development cohort and 1072 deaths (13\%) in the validation cohort. Twelve independent predictors of mortality were identified: 2 demographic variables (age: 60-64 years, 1 point; 65-69 years, 2 points; 70-74 years, 3 points; 75-79 years, 4 points; 80-84 years, 5 points, {$>$}85 years, 7 points and male sex, 2 points), 6 comorbid conditions (diabetes, 1 point; cancer, 2 points; lung disease, 2 points; heart failure, 2 points; current tobacco use, 2 points; and body mass index {$<$}25, 1 point), and difficulty with 4 functional variables (bathing, 2 points; walking several blocks, 2 points; managing money, 2 points, and pushing large objects, 1 point. Scores on the risk index were strongly associated with 4-year mortality in the validation cohort, with 0 to 5 points predicting a less than 4\% risk, 6 to 9 points predicting a 15\% risk, 10 to 13 points predicting a 42\% risk, and 14 or more points predicting a 64\% risk. The risk index showed excellent discrimination with a cstatistic of 0.84 in the development cohort and 0.82 in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: This prognostic index, incorporating age, sex, self-reported comorbid conditions, and functional measures, accurately stratifies community-dwelling older adults into groups at varying risk of mortality.},

Studies that used receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and published area under the ROC curves (AUC) for overweight and obesity indices with hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia were included. The AUC for each of the four indices, with each risk factor, was pooled using a random-effects model; male and female data were analyzed separately. RESULTS Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Body mass index (BMI) was the poorest discriminator for cardiovascular risk factors. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was the best discriminator for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia in both sexes; its pooled AUC (95\% confidence intervals) ranged from 0.67 (0.64, 0.69) to 0.73 (0.70, 0.75) and from 0.68 (0.63, 0.72) to 0.76 (0.70, 0.81) in males and females, respectively.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend incorporating life expectancy (LE) into clinical decision-making for preventive interventions such as cancer screening. Previous research focused on mortality risk (e.g. 28\% at 4 years) which is more difficult to interpret than LE (e.g. 7.3 years) for both patients and clinicians. Our objective was to utilize the Gompertz Law of Human Mortality which states that mortality risk doubles in a fixed time interval to transform the Lee mortality index into a LE calculator. METHODS: We examined community-dwelling older adults age 50 and over enrolled in the nationally representative 1998 wave of the Health and Retirement Study or HRS (response rate 81\%), dividing study respondents into development (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}11701) and validation (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}8009) cohorts. In the development cohort, we fit proportional hazards Gompertz survival functions for each of the risk groups defined by the Lee mortality index. We validated our LE estimates by comparing our predicted LE with observed survival in the HRS validation cohort and an external validation cohort from the 2004 wave of the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing or ELSA (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}7042). RESULTS: The ELSA cohort had a lower 8-year mortality risk (14\%) compared to our HRS development (23\%) and validation cohorts (25\%). Our model had good discrimination in the validation cohorts (Harrell's c 0.78 in HRS and 0.80 in the ELSA). Our predicted LE's were similar to observed survival in the HRS validation cohort without evidence of miscalibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.2 at 8 years). However, our predicted LE's were longer than observed survival in the ELSA cohort with evidence of miscalibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, p{$<$}0.001 at 8 years) reflecting the lower mortality rate in ELSA. CONCLUSION: We transformed a previously validated mortality index into a LE calculator that incorporated patient-level risk factors. Our LE calculator may help clinicians determine which preventive interventions are most appropriate for older US adults.},

  abstract = {Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is not only an objective measure of habitual physical activity, but also a useful diagnostic and prognostic health indicator for patients in clinical settings. Although compelling evidence has shown that CRF is a strong and independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, the importance of CRF is often overlooked from a clinical perspective compared with other risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or obesity. Several prospective studies indicate that CRF is at least as important as the traditional risk factors, and is often more strongly associated with mortality. In addition, previous studies report that CRF appears to attenuate the increased risk of death associated with obesity. Most individuals can improve their CRF through regular physical activity. Several biological mechanisms suggest that CRF improves insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, body composition, inflammation, and blood pressure. Based on the evidence, health professionals should encourage their patients to improve CRF through regular physical activity.},

Despite the close link between cigarette smoking and the development of bladder cancer, little is known about the influence of cigarette smoking on the bladder cancer prognosis after radical cystectomy. The cigarette smoking status of 602 patients who had undergone radical cystectomy for bladder cancer was determined using questionnaires completed before surgery. The effect of cigarette smoking on recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival was determined. Of the 340 patients with a smoking history, 159 were current smokers. The smokers were younger (P~= .001) and more likely to be male (P~= .001) than were the nonsmokers. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate of the smokers and nonsmokers was 62.1\% and 56.8\% (P~=~.182), the 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was 67.3\%, 63.9\% (P~= .436), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 63.0\% and 58.8\% (P~= .309), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that smoking was not an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival or cancer-specific survival. After adjusting for other prognostic variables, cigarette smoking status (non-, ex-, or current smoker), cumulative exposure, and years from smoking cessation were not associated with cancer-specific survival (P~= .378, P~= .827, and P~= .876, respectively). The results of the present study found no association between cigarette smoking and the prognosis of bladder cancer after radical cystectomy.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between May 1987 and December 1990, 49 patients undergoing radical cystectomy for locally advanced bladder cancer were randomized to observation only or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with three cycles of MVAC/MVEC (methotrexate 30~mg/m2~on day 1, 15 and 22; vinblastine 3~mg/m2~on day 2, 15 and 22; doxorubicin 30~mg/m2 or epirubicin 45~mg/m2~on day 2; and cisplatin 70~mg/m2~on day 2 of a 28-day cycle). Data were obtained for progression-free, overall and tumour-specific survival. RESULTS In all, 23 patients were randomized to the control arm and 26 to treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy. The trial intended to accrue 100 patients but was stopped after an interim analysis showed a marked difference in progression free-survival when these first 49 patients had been randomized. The intent-to-treat analysis, including hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals and point estimates at 10~years for control vs adjuvant chemotherapy, was as follows: progression-free survival HR 2.84 (1.46–5.54; P= 0.002), 13.0\% vs 43.7\%; overall survival HR 1.75 (0.95–3.23; P= 0.069), 17.4\% vs 26.9\%; and tumour-specific survival HR 2.52 (1.28–4.99; P= 0.007), 17.4\% vs 41.7\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The long-term results further support the use of adjuvant-combined chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens after radical cystectomy for locally advanced bladder cancer, as this significantly improves progression-free and tumour-specific survival.},

This period covers successively an initial period during the induction treatment and a consolidation period during the postinduction treatment. From 1994 to 2002, 922 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (excluding French-American-British L3 subtype) were enrolled in a multicentre protocol and followed, with a mean follow up of 58 months. A multivariate time-segmented analysis was performed on 658 patients. Analyses of the initial (before 100 d) and the late phases were realised after stratification on the type of induction treatment and on the different treatment strategies respectively. Age was the sole factor that influenced survival during the initial phase (hazard ratio 1.48 per 10-yr increase; P {$<$} 0.01). Factors that predicted survival during the late phase were age (hazard ratio 1.12, P = 0.02), white blood cells count (hazard ratio 1.01 per 10(10) cells/L increase; P {$<$} 0.05), lactic dehydrogenase level (hazard ratio 1.001 for 10 IU/L increase; P {$<$} 0.01) and t(9;22) karyotype or miscellaneous others vs. normal karyotype (hazard ratios 1.40; P {$<$} 0.01 and 1.06; P = 0.04 respectively). This analysis suggests that predictive factors may be split into tolerance factors and haematological factors. Determination of such factors is crucial to adapt postremission therapeutic strategies in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.},

The study aim was to assess the effect of cardiovascular risk factors on early and late outcome after valve replacement with a bioprosthesis for aortic stenosis (AS), and the impact of these factors on the outcome of the bioprosthesis. METHODS: Preoperative clinical, biological and echocardiographic data were recorded in 222 patients (110 males, 112 females; mean age 73 +/- 8 years) who underwent surgery for severe AS between 1989 and 1993. The mean follow up was 7.3 +/- 4.7 years; total follow up was 1,621 patient-years (pt-yr). RESULTS: Overall 12-year actuarial survival rate was 36.1\%. Independent predictors of mortality were age (hazards ratio (HR) 1.11; 95\% CI: 1.08-1.14, p {$<$} 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (DM) (HR 2.53; 95\% CI: 1.65-3.88, p {$<$} 0.0001), male gender (HR 2.17; 95\% CI: 1.53-3.12, p {$<$} 0.0001), and NYHA class (HR 1.66; 95\% CI: 1.17-2.34, p = 0.004). Other cardiovascular risk factors had no significant effect on survival. DM and NYHA class were also independent predictive factors for valve-related death and overall valve-related complications. The 12-year actuarial survival was 13\% in DM patients compared to 38\% in non-diabetic patients (p = 0.003), with a significant increase in cardiovascular death (p = 0.0028), and a non-significant increase in thromboembolic events (p = 0.08) in DM patients. The only independent predictive risk factor of structural valve failure in multivariate analysis was renal failure (HR 1.1, 95\% CI: 1.03-1.16, p = 0.047). Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, DM, hypertension, tobacco smoking and obesity had no effect on the outcome of the bioprosthesis. CONCLUSION: Age, male gender, DM and NYHA class were the main predictors for long-term mortality after bioprosthesis implantation for AS. DM significantly impaired survival, with an excess of cardiovascular deaths and thromboembolic events. Other cardiovascular risk factors had no significant effect on either survival or bioprosthesis durability.},

  abstract = {The epidemiology of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is incompletely understood. A number of difficulties exist in estimating the prevalence and incidence of CP. Long-term follow-up is often problematic, especially in chronic alcoholics, and obtaining a formal and standardised diagnosis can take years. The available studies are reasonably consistent in their estimation of the incidence of CP but few studies have attempted to estimate prevalence. Although life expectancy in CP is diminished compared with control populations, median survival lies in the range of 15–20 years. Such a survival would suggest a prevalence of CP rather higher than that determined from the survey studies. A recent epidemiological study in France found an annual incidence of 7.8 per 100,000. Assuming a survival of 15–20 years, the annual prevalence should be between 120 to 143 per 100,000. Overall, our understanding of the epidemiology of CP is poor compared with other illnesses. We consider that both prevalence and the rate of pancreatic insufficiency and of CP are currently underestimated. There is a distinct need for more studies to remedy this lack of knowledge.},

The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of existing SMs for obesity. First, a background section introduces the different types of models, explains how models are constructed, shows the utility of SMs and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. Using these typologies, we then briefly review extant obesity SMs. We categorize these models according to their focus: health and economic outcomes, trends in obesity as a function of past trends, physiologically based behavioural models, environmental contributors to obesity and policy interventions.

  abstract = {To assess the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and the incidence and disease-specific mortality of endometrial cancer (EC). MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference abstracts of the 2011–2013 Annual Meetings of Society of Gynecological Oncology were searched for reports of original cohort studies that enrolled diabetic and non-diabetic women who were free of EC at baseline to compare the incidence and disease-specific mortality of EC by DM status. The included reports were examined for demographic characteristics of study populations, study design, effect measures and risk of bias. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated with Chi-square test of the Cochrane Q statistics at the 0.05 significance level and I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed by visual examination of a funnel plot and the Egger's test for small-study effects. Twenty-nine cohort studies (17 prospective, 12 retrospective) were eligible for this review, 23 of which reported EC incidence, five reported disease-specific mortality and one reported both. For incidence of EC among women with versus without DM, the summary relative risk (RR) was 1.89 (95\%CI, 1.46–2.45; p{$<$}0.001) and the summary incidence rate ratio was 1.61 (95\%CI, 1.51–1.71; p{$<$}0.001). The pooled RR of disease-specific mortality was 1.32 (95\%CI, 1.10–1.60; p=0.003), while results in the studies reporting standardized mortality ratios were inconsistent. There remains considerable amount of clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the included studies; moreover, the hazard ratios for incident EC showed significant statistical heterogeneity and therefore were not quantitatively synthesized. There is consistent evidence for an independent association between DM and an increased risk of incident EC, while the association between DM and EC-specific mortality remains uncertain. Further studies with better considerations for selection bias, information bias and confounding will further facilitate causal inference involving DM and EC.},

Methods: We followed 300\,398 women aged 19–67 years at enrolment until 31 December 2013 for OC incidence through linkage to national registries. We used Cox proportional hazards models with attained age as the underlying time scale to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for relevant confounders. Results: During more than 5.9 million person-years and a median follow-up time of 19 years, 2336 primary invasive (1647, 71\%) and borderline (689, 29\%) OC were identified (53\% serous, 19\% mucinous). Compared with never smokers, current smokers who had smoked for ⩾10 years had a higher risk of mucinous OC (HR10–19 years vs never=1.73, 95\% CI 1.24–2.42; HR⩾20 vs never=2.26, 95\% CI 1.77–2.89, Ptrend {$<$}0.001). When stratified by invasiveness, current smokers had a higher risk of invasive mucinous OC (HR=1.78, 95\% CI 1.20–2.64) and borderline mucinous OC (HR=2.26 95\% CI, 1.71–2.97) (Pheterogeneity=0.34) than never smokers. Smoking was not associated with serous or endometrioid OC. Conclusions: Using a very large cohort of women, the current analysis provides an important replication for a similar risk of invasive and borderline mucinous OC related to smoking.},

  abstract = {The rate of increase in longevity has varied considerably across U.S. states since 1991. This paper examines the effect of medical innovation (changes in drug vintage), behavioral risk factors (obesity, smoking, and AIDS incidence), and other variables (education, income, and health insurance coverage) on longevity using longitudinal state-level data. This approach controls for the effects of unobserved factors that vary across states but are relatively stable over time (e.g., climate and environmental quality); and unobserved factors that change over time but are invariant across states (e.g., changes in federal government policies). We also analyze interstate variation in productivity (output per employee) growth and in the growth of per-capita medical expenditure (total and by type). States in which the vintage of both self- and provider-administered drugs grew faster than average had above-average increases in life expectancy, whether or not we adjust for state-specific changes in the distribution of disease. Life expectancy grew more slowly in states with larger increases (or slower declines) in AIDS, obesity, and smoking rates. States with high income growth had smaller longevity increases. States with larger increases in Medicaid drug vintage had faster productivity growth, conditional on income growth and the other factors. The increase in Medicaid drug vintage is estimated to have increased output per employee by about 1\% per year. Much of this may be attributable to increased hours worked per employee. Increases in income, education, smoking, and the incidence of AIDS tend to increase per-capita medical expenditure; expanded health insurance coverage reduces it. States in which drug vintage has increased the most have not had above-average increases in overall medical expenditure. While use of newer drugs has increased some types of medical expenditure, it has reduced other types, and the expenditure reductions approximately offset the expenditure increases. Although use of newer drugs does not appear to have increased annual medical expenditure, it probably has increased lifetime medical expenditure, but the increase in lifetime medical cost per life-year gained from using newer drugs has been quite low. The estimates indicate that the growth in obesity and the growth in income both reduced the growth in life expectancy. If obesity and income had not increased, life expectancy at birth would have increased by 3.88 years. The increases in Medicaid and Medicare drug vintage account for 2.43 years (63\%) of the “potential increase” in life expectancy. The declines in AIDS incidence and smoking account for 0.23 and 0.12 (6\% and 3\%), respectively, of the potential increase in life expectancy. About 1.1 years (28\%) of the potential increase in life expectancy at birth is unexplained. Differences in drug vintage explain some of the interstate variation in life expectancy, but the fraction of cross-sectional variance explained is smaller than the fraction of aggregate time-series variance (growth) explained.},

  abstract = {The cause of motor neuron disease (MND) remains unknown although recent reports have suggested a possible rise in mortality rate. The present account describes age-specific patterns in morbidity rate and cross-sectional and cohort analyses of mortality rate, and compares these with those in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. First hospital admission rate for motor neuron disease (a proxy for incidence rates) rose steadily with age in males and females until the age of 75 years or more, but then fell, but only in females. This irregular pattern suggested the possibility of an environmental effect on certain older birth cohorts. The validity of the results was supported by a similar pattern in the two hospital regional authorities studied and the difference between this pattern and that found in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Age-specific mortality rates of motor neuron disease between 15 and 64 years for males and females in England and Wales from 1940 to 1982 rose steadily with age. Mortality rates after the age of 65 fell in all female cohorts studied, but only in the earlier male cohorts. Unlike Parkinson's disease there was no strong birth cohort effect. However an analysis of Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (Registrar General) reports has revealed a slight increase in the age-specific mortality rate in both males and females aged 65 and over for successive birth cohorts born since 1900. Neither changes in ICD coding or in diagnostic habits could account for this pattern, which differed from that seen in Parkinson's disease. No such effect was seen in multiple sclerosis.},

In 1993, 3470 patients meeting the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia were assessed. We used national death certificate data to identify patients that had died by suicide for each year included in the study. In this way, we calculated standardized mortality ratios, adjusting for age and sex relative to the general population. We used Cox's proportional hazards models to investigate potential sociodemographic and clinical risk factors. There were 141 suicides in the cohort during the follow-up period, corresponding to a risk of suicide that was approximately 16 times higher than that of the general population. Women had slightly higher standardized mortality ratios than men. Suicide was the cause of death in more than half (53.9\%) of deaths occurring during the first year of follow-up and nearly one-third (31.8\%) of those occurring in the ten-year period of the study. There were four significant baseline predictors of suicide remaining in the final logistic regression model: male gender, drug abuse, previous suicide attempts, and short duration of illness. Sex, age, history of suicide attempt should be particularly considered in the assessment of suicide risk in schizophrenic patients. Our findings also emphasize the need for detection and effective management of associated comorbid drug abuse.},

METHODS: Annual age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates were compared for adults ({$>$}20 years) with and without diabetes in Ontario, Canada, and the UK from January 1996 to December 2009 using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) and Ontario databases. The total number of individuals evaluated increased from 8,757,772 in 1996 to 12,696,305 in 2009. RESULTS: The excess risk of mortality for individuals with diabetes in both cohorts was significantly lower during later vs earlier years of the follow-up period (1996-2009). In Ontario the diabetes mortality rate ratio decreased from 1.90 (95\% CI 1.86, 1.94) in 1996 to 1.51 (1.48, 1.54) in 2009, and in THIN from 2.14 (1.97, 2.32) to 1.65 (1.57, 1.72), respectively. In Ontario and THIN, the mortality rate ratios among diabetic patients in 2009 were 1.67 (1.61, 1.72) and 1.81 (1.68, 1.94) for those aged 65-74 years and 1.11 (1.10, 1.13) and 1.19 (1.14, 1.24) for those aged over 74 years, respectively. Corresponding rate ratios in Ontario and THIN were 2.45 (2.36, 2.54) and 2.64 (2.39, 2.89) for individuals aged 45-64 years, and 4.89 (4.35, 5.45) and 5.18 (3.73, 6.69) for those aged 20-44 years. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The excess risk of mortality in individuals with vs without diabetes has decreased over time in both Canada and the UK. This may be in part due to earlier detection and higher prevalence of early diabetes, as well as to improvements in diabetes care.},

Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the relative risks for all-cause mortality during a maximum follow-up period of 10 years. Four obesity-related anthropometric indices—body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio—were the main variables of interest., During the follow-up period, 628 and 2366 participants died among HBV and non-HBV carriers, respectively. Both underweight and general obesity were associated with an increased risk of death. The highest risk of all-cause death in relation to BMI was found in the HBV carriers with underweight (BMI {$<$}18.5{$\mkern1mu$}kg/m2) and non-HBV carriers with obesity (BMI ≥30{$\mkern1mu$}kg/m2). The lowest risks of all-cause death in relation to abdominal adiposity were found at the third quartiles of waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio among HBV carriers, but in the second quartiles among non-HBV carriers. For those with pre-existing liver disease among HBV carriers, patients with underweight have higher risk of death than those with obesity., Hepatitis B virus carriers with underweight have higher risk of death than non-HBV carriers.

  abstract = {Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text, Statin intake has been reported to reduce the risk of several malignancies beyond its cholesterol-lowering effects. However, little is known regarding the survival benefit of statins for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)., We conducted a systematic literature search of multiple databases for studies published before November 2014, which investigated associations between statin intake and CRC prognosis. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects model. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality (ACM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM)., Ten studies involving 76,851 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis, with 7 studies investigating prediagnosis statin use and 5 studies reporting postdiagnosis statin use. Prediagnosis statin use was associated with reduced ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.61–0.88, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.001) and CSM (HR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.77–0.84, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001) for patients with CRC. This effect persisted when stratified by tumor site and in studies adjusted by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. In addition, postdiagnosis statin use was associated with decreased CSM (HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.60–0.82, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). However, we did not note reduced ACM for postdiagnosis statin use (HR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.68–1.27, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.639). There appeared to be an association between postdiagnosis statin use and increased ACM in KRAS-mutated CRC., Our findings provide evidence that prediagnosis statin therapy was associated with reduced ACM and CSM in CRC patients; postdiagnosis statin therapy indicated decreased CSM. However, findings may not apply to patients with postdiagnosis statin therapy for ACM. Further studies are warranted to determine the relation between statin dose and duration on CRC survival.},

This paradox may be explained by systemic inflammation and/or malnutrition, which are associated with lower cholesterol levels and higher mortality.ObjectiveTo determine the relationship between cholesterol level and outcome in patients undergoing dialysis, accounting for inflammation and malnutrition.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective study of 823 patients enrolled from October 1995 to June 1998 who recently initiated dialysis, from 79 clinics, classified by absence or presence of inflammation and/or malnutrition (defined as serum albumin levels \&lt;3.6 mg/dL, C-reactive protein ≥10 mg/L, or interleukin 6 ≥3.09 pg/mL).Main Outcome MeasuresAll-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 324 deaths (159 CVD deaths), 153 renal transplantations, and 10 losses to follow-up occurred. Average serum cholesterol level was lower in the presence of inflammation/malnutrition than in its absence. In a Cox model adjusted for age, race, and sex, a 40-mg/dL (1.0-mmol/L) increment in baseline total serum cholesterol level was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality overall (relative hazard [RH], 0.92; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.98) and in the presence of inflammation/malnutrition (RH, 0.89; CI, 0.84-0.95). In contrast, serum cholesterol level was associated with an increased risk in the absence of inflammation/malnutrition (RH, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.63). For CVD mortality, an inverse trend was not statistically significant in the presence of inflammation/malnutrition, and a positive association was evident in the absence of inflammation/malnutrition (RH, 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.89). Further adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, dialysis modality, comorbidity, and inflammatory markers attenuated the inverse association but strengthened the positive association.ConclusionsThe inverse association of total cholesterol level with mortality in dialysis patients is likely due to the cholesterol-lowering effect of systemic inflammation and malnutrition, not to a protective effect of high cholesterol concentrations. These findings support treatment of hypercholesterolemia in this population.},

However, subgroup analysis revealed that elderly male patients exhibited a higher mortality rate than non-elderly male patients (29.4\% vs 21.3\%, log-rank χ2=5.898, P=0.015), while no difference was observed between the elderly female patients and non-elderly female patients. In the Cox analysis, neither age nor sex was a significant independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with DCM. Conclusion In conclusion, no significant difference in mortality between male and female patients or between the elderly and non-elderly patients was observed. Only among males was a difference in mortality observed; elderly male patients experienced greater mortality than that of non-elderly male patients. No effect of age or sex on all-cause mortality was observed in patients with DCM.},

  abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder but data on survival rates are still conflicting and have not so far been quantitatively reviewed. The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of cohort studies to assess pooled survival rates and prognostic factors for survival in patients with HCM. Nineteen studies were included representing 12,146 HCM patients. The pooled 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 98.0\%, 94.3\%, 82.2\% and 75.0\%, respectively. Among patients with HCM, age, NYHA functional class, family history of sudden death (FHSD), syncope, atrial fibrillation, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (nsVT), maximum left ventricular wall thickness and obstruction were significant prognostic factors for cardiovascular death. For sudden cardiac death, FHSD, nsVT, and obstruction showed significant predictive values. Moreover, estimation of population attributable risk (PAR) suggested that nsVT was the strongest predictor for cardiovascular death (13.02\%, 95\% CI 3.60–25.91\%), while left ventricular outflow tract obstruction/mid-ventricular obstruction (LVO/MVO) was the strongest predictor for all-cause death and sudden cardiac death (10.09\%, 95\% CI 4.72–20.42\% and 16.44\%, 95\% CI 7.45–31.55\%, respectively). These risk factors may thus be useful for identifying HCM patients who might benefit from early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between demographic and clinical features in early Parkinson disease (PD) and length of survival in a multiethnic population. DESIGN: Clinical features within 2 years of diagnosis were determined for an inception cohort established during 1994-1995. Vital status was determined through December 31, 2005. Predictor variables included age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, as well as clinical subtype (modified tremor dominant, postural instability gait difficulty), symmetry, cognitive impairment, depression, dysphagia, and hallucinations. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with shorter survival. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, northern California. PATIENTS: Five hundred seventy-three men and women with newly diagnosed PD. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-two participants in the PD cohort (61.4\%) had died in the follow-up period. Older age at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.12), modified postural instability gait difficulty subtype (HR, 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.7), symmetry of motor signs (HR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.1-3.7), mild (HR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.2) and severe (HR, 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.9-3.9) cognitive impairment, dysphagia (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.9), and hallucinations (HR, 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.3-3.2) were associated with increased all-cause mortality, after adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. None of the other factors altered mortality risk. In an empirical predictive analysis, most previous significant predictors remained associated with shorter survival. CONCLUSIONS: Both motor and nonmotor features in early PD predict increased mortality risk, particularly postural instability gait difficulty, cognitive impairment, and hallucinations. These predictors may be useful in clinical practice and when designing clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relatively rare disease with a reported population incidence of between 1.5 and 2.5 per 100,000 per year. Over the past 10 years, the design of ALS epidemiological studies has evolved to focus on a prospective, population based methodology, employing the El Escorial criteria and multiple sources of data to ensure complete case ascertainment. Five such studies, based in Europe and North America, have been published and show remarkably consistent incidence figures among their respective Caucasian populations. Population based studies have been useful in defining clinical characteristics and prognostic indicators in ALS. However, many epidemiological questions remain that cannot be resolved by any of the existing population based datasets. The working hypotheses is that ALS, like other chronic diseases, is a complex genetic condition, and the relative contributions of individual environmental and genetic factors are likely to be relatively small. Larger studies are required to characterise risks and identify subpopulations that might be suitable for further study. This current paper outlines the contribution of the various population based registers, identifies the limitations of the existing datasets and proposes a mechanism to improve the future design and output of descriptive epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {Few studies have reported the risk of death related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in large population-based cohorts. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of AD on all-cause mortality in a nationwide sample of persons with AD. Community-dwelling persons with AD and an equal number of individually matched (age, gender, and region of residence) control persons without AD were identified from the registers of Social Insurance Institution of Finland at the end of 2005. Deaths in this sample (n = 56,041, mean age 79.7 years, 67.8\% women) during a 57-month follow-up period were recorded. Using a nested case-control design, unadjusted and adjusted (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and asthma and/or COPD) hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using proportional hazards regression. The results were categorized according to age at death ({$<$}80, 80 to 89, ≥ 90 years) and duration of AD (≤ 3, 4 to 6, ≥ 7 years). The unadjusted HR for death associated with AD was 2.03 (95\% CI: 1.97 to 2.09). The HR was highest in the youngest age category [HR = 3.46 (95\% CI: 3.18 to 3.77)], and still significantly elevated in the oldest age category [HR = 1.50 (95\% CI: 1.41 to 1.60)]. Comorbidity adjustments did not change the HRs, and even a short duration of AD (≤ 3 years) was associated with a significantly increased risk of death. In conclusion, AD was associated with an increased risk of death that was more pronounced at younger ages and existed even after a recent diagnosis of AD.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of outcome according to the time frame can help optimize the therapeutic development in severe alcoholic hepatitis. We assessed short-term and long-term survival in severe alcoholic hepatitis based on baseline disease severity, extent of therapeutic improvement, long-term influence of alcohol relapse, and their interaction. Data and alcohol consumption were prospectively recorded in 398 patients treated with corticosteroids in the short term (from corticosteroid initiation to 6 months) and long term (from 6 months to maximum follow-up time). Cumulative incidence rate of first alcohol relapse was 25.2\%, 33.7\%, and 35.2\% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Alcohol relapse (≥30 g/day) was not associated with mortality (P = 0.24) during the short-term period (1,606 patient-months at risk), but the Lille (P {$<$} 0.0001) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (P {$<$} 0.0001) scores were independent prognostic factors. In patients who were alive at 6 months (median follow-up, 42 months; interquartile range 11-88), corresponding to 10,413 patient-months at risk, alcohol consumption (≥30 g/day) was associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 3.9; P {$<$} 0.0001). Additional analysis with abstinent patients as a reference showed a dose effect of alcohol on the hazard ratio of death: 2.36 (P = 0.052) for 1-29 g/day, 3.2 (P = 0.003) for 30-49 g/day, 3.51 (P {$<$} 0.0001) for 50-99 g/day, and 5.61 (P {$<$} 0.0001) for ≥ 100 g/day. The baseline Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was not predictive of long-term outcome, while Lille score (P = 0.02) and alcohol relapse (P {$<$} 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: This study shows that new therapeutic development for severe alcoholic hepatitis must target liver injury in the short term and alcohol consumption in the long term; thus, health agencies can endorse future study designs adapted to the time frame of factors influencing mortality; with this in mind, drug-targeting mechanisms involved in liver injury should only be tested for the short-term period.

Patients with chronic pancreatitis are known to have a reduced life expectancy, but the quantitative relationship between various clinical features and survival is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated survival among 2015 subjects with chronic pancreatitis treated at seven centers located in six countries. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 46 +/- 13 yr and mean duration of follow-up was 7.4 +/- 6.2 yr. Overall survival at 10 yr was 70\% (95\% confidence interval (CI), 68-73\%) and at 20 yr was 45\% (95\% CI, 41-49\%). Survival was significantly less than in the background population. There were 559 deaths observed among those with chronic pancreatitis compared with an expected number of 157.4, yielding a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 3.6 (95\% CI, 3.3-3.9). Older subjects and those with alcoholic pancreatitis had a significant reduction in survival. In a multivariate analysis, mortality of middle-aged and older subjects was 2.3 (95\% CI, 1.8-2.8) and 6.3 (95\% CI, 4.7-8.3) times greater than subjects less than 40 yr at diagnosis. Smoking (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.9), drinking (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.2), or development of cirrhosis (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95\% CI, 2.0-3.2) increased the risk of death during the observation period, but we observed no survival difference in operated vs. nonoperated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Age at diagnosis, smoking, and drinking are major predictors of mortality in patients with chronic pancreatitis.},

  abstract = {The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is widely used to predict the short-term mortality in patients with cirrhosis, but potential limitations of this score have been reported. The aim of this study was to improve the score's prognostic accuracy by assessing new objective variables. Data of 310 consecutive patients with cirrhosis who underwent elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement between July 1995 and March 2005 were analyzed retrospectively. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed by proportional hazard Cox regression models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) and the likelihood ratio test were used to evaluate the performance of the models for predicting early mortality. Findings were validated in a cohort of 451 consecutive patients with cirrhosis on waiting list for liver transplantation. Bivariate analyses showed that the following variables correlated with time to death: age, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, serum albumin, serum sodium, and MELD. Multivariate analysis revealed that MELD, serum sodium, and age were independently associated with the risk of death. The integrated MELD model (iMELD, incorporating serum sodium and age) was better than original MELD in predicting 12-month mortality: auROC increased by 13.4\% and the likelihood ratio statistic from 23.5 to 48.2. The improved accuracy of iMELD was confirmed in the validation sample of 451 patients with cirrhosis on the waiting list for liver transplantation by increasing auROC (+8\%) and likelihood ratio statistic (from 41.4 to 82.0). This study shows that in patients with cirrhosis, serum sodium and age are predictors of mortality independent of the MELD score. The incorporation of these variables into the original MELD formula improves the predictive accuracy of time to death. Liver Transpl 13:1174–1180, 2007. © 2007 AASLD.},

We evaluated the incidence patterns and time trends of 1582 cases of PL that had been reclassified according to the WHO classification of hematological malignancies. Data regarding clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome were also collected for each case. The World Age-Standardized Rate (ASR) was calculated as 13.4, 2.2 and 3.4 per 100,000 people for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), T-cell NHL and Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL), respectively, with an increase of 1.62\% per year during the study period. The lymphoma subtype showing the highest incidence was found to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with an ASR of 4.8. Compared with reports from other western countries, our series is characterized by a higher incidence of HL and indolent B-NHL in general, and of CLL/SLL (ASR\,=\,3.3) and marginal zone NHL (ASR\,=\,1.5), in particular, and also by a lower incidence of FL (ASR\,=\,2). After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year relative survival for the whole series was found to be 70\% with a statistically significant improvement for cases diagnosed during 2002–2003 (from 66 to 74\%; p\,=\,0.03). Survival improvement within the study period was also evident for patients with DLBCL, HL and T-NHL. Our study provides a comprehensive description of both the epidemiological and clinical features of PL cases in Modena and our data also reflect the major advances in the curability of some histological subtypes of this disease. The usefulness of a population-based approach to better characterizing different lymphoma subtypes is also demonstrated. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most longitudinal studies showed increased relative mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus until now. As a result of major changes in treatment regimes over the past years, with more stringent goals for metabolic control and cardiovascular risk management, improvement of life expectancy should be expected. In our study, we aimed to assess present-day life expectancy of type 2 diabetes patients in an ongoing cohort study. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included 973 primary care type 2 diabetes patients in a prospective cohort study, who were all participating in a shared care project in The Netherlands. Vital status was assessed from May 2001 till May 2007. Main outcome measurement was life expectancy assessed by transforming actual survival time to standardised survival time allowing adjustment for the baseline mortality rate of the general population. At baseline, mean age was 66 years, mean HbA(1c) 7.0\%. During a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 165 patients died (78 from cardiovascular causes), and 17 patients were lost to follow-up. There were no differences in life expectancy in subjects with type 2 diabetes compared to life expectancy in the general population. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, concentrating on the endpoints 'all-cause' and cardiovascular mortality, a history of cardiovascular disease: hazard ratio (HR) 1.71 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.37), and HR 2.59 (95\% CI 1.56-4.28); and albuminuria: HR 1.72 (95\% CI 1.26-2.35), and HR 1.83 (95\% CI 1.17-2.89), respectively, were significant predictors, whereas smoking, HbA(1c), systolic blood pressure and diabetes duration were not. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a normal life expectancy in a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes patients in primary care when compared to the general population. A history of cardiovascular disease and albuminuria, however, increased the risk of a reduction of life expectancy. These results show that, in a shared care environment, a normal life expectancy is achievable in type 2 diabetes patients.},

  abstract = {Aspirin and other NSAIDs are widely used as analgesics and the former is a preventative agent for vascular events. It is unclear whether their long-term use affects cancer risk. Data on the chemopreventative role of these drugs on the mortality in patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancer (UADT) are insufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aspirin and other NSAIDs on survival in UADT cancer patients. An observational cohort study of patients with UADT cancer was undertaken using Primary Care Clinical Informatics Unit (PCCIU) database of electronic medical records in Scotland. Information was available on all prescriptions of aspirin and other NSAIDs before and after diagnosis. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used for statistical data analysis. There were 2392 patients diagnosed with UADT cancer between 1996 and 2010. Mean age of patients was 66 years (SD 12) and most were male (63\%). Median survival in head and neck (HNC) patients was 94 months, while median survival in oesophageal cancer patients was 10 months. For HNC improved survival was observed with aspirin prescription (ever vs never hazard ratio (HR) 0.56 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.44, 0.71), there was no association with Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors (COX-2) prescriptions. Improved survival was observed with other NSAIDs prescription (ever vs never HR 0.74 95\% CI 0.60, 0.90). For oesophageal cancer patients, improved survival was observed with aspirin prescriptions (ever vs never HR 0.54 95\% CI 0.45, 0.64), COX-2 prescriptions (HR 0.78 95\% CI 0.62, 0.98) and other NSAIDs (HR 0.67 95\% CI 0.56, 0.80). Aspirin and other NSAIDs prescriptions after diagnosis are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality in UADT cancer patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparisons among countries can help to identify opportunities for the reduction of inequalities in health. We compared the magnitude of inequalities in mortality and self-assessed health among 22 countries in all parts of Europe. METHODS: We obtained data on mortality according to education level and occupational class from census-based mortality studies. Deaths were classified according to cause, including common causes, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer; causes related to smoking; causes related to alcohol use; and causes amenable to medical intervention, such as tuberculosis and hypertension. Data on self-assessed health, smoking, and obesity according to education and income were obtained from health or multipurpose surveys. For each country, the association between socioeconomic status and health outcomes was measured with the use of regression-based inequality indexes. RESULTS: In almost all countries, the rates of death and poorer self-assessments of health were substantially higher in groups of lower socioeconomic status, but the magnitude of the inequalities between groups of higher and lower socioeconomic status was much larger in some countries than in others. Inequalities in mortality were small in some southern European countries and very large in most countries in the eastern and Baltic regions. These variations among countries appeared to be attributable in part to causes of death related to smoking or alcohol use or amenable to medical intervention. The magnitude of inequalities in self-assessed health also varied substantially among countries, but in a different pattern. CONCLUSIONS: We observed variation across Europe in the magnitude of inequalities in health associated with socioeconomic status. These inequalities might be reduced by improving educational opportunities, income distribution, health-related behavior, or access to health care.},

  abstract = {A single early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level has been correlated with a higher likelihood of prostate cancer diagnosis and death in younger men. PSA testing in older men has been considered of limited utility. We evaluated prostate cancer death in relation to age and PSA level immediately prior to prostate cancer diagnosis. Using the Veterans Affairs database, we identified 230,081 men aged 50–89\,years diagnosed with prostate cancer and at least one prior PSA test between 1999 and 2009. Prostate cancer-specific death over time was calculated for patients stratified by age group (e.g., 50–59\,years, through 80–89\,years) and PSA range at diagnosis (10 ranges) using Kaplan–Meier methods. Risk of 10-year prostate cancer mortality across age and PSA was compared using log-rank tests with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. 10.5\% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer died of cancer during the 10-year study period (mean follow-up\,=\,3.7\,years). Higher PSA values prior to diagnosis predict a higher risk of death in all age groups (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Within the same PSA range, older age groups are at increased risk for death from prostate cancer (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). For PSA of 7–10\,ng/mL, cancer-specific death, 10\,years after diagnosis, increased from 7\% for age 50–59\,years to 51\% for age 80–89\,years. Men older than 70\,years are more likely to die of prostate cancer at any PSA level than younger men, suggesting prostate cancer remains a significant problem among older men (even those aged 80+) and deserves additional study.},

We conducted comprehensive searches of studies reporting a ratio of mortality in PD versus controls, descriptive survival measures, or factors predicting survival; assessed study quality; and extracted relevant data. Descriptive analysis, meta-analysis, and meta-regression were performed as appropriate. Eighty-eight studies were included in the review with variable study methods and quality. Almost all studies reported increased mortality in PD (vs. controls), with mortality ratios ranging from 0.9 to 3.8, with major between-study heterogeneity. Inception cohorts were more consistent with a pooled mortality ratio of approximately 1.5. Inception cohorts, measurements at longer follow-up duration, and older study recruitment year were associated with lower mortality ratios, but these findings were not robust in sensitivity analyses. Within studies, mortality ratios increased over time. No robust evidence was found that mortality has decreased after the introduction of levodopa (L-dopa). On average, PD survival reduced by approximately 5\% every year of follow-up, although there was significant heterogeneity. In post-mortem studies, mean duration until death ranged from 6.9 to 14.3 years. Increasing age and presence of dementia were most commonly associated with increased mortality. Parkinson's disease is associated with increased mortality, but major heterogeneity is seen in estimates of mortality, which is probably explained by variable methodology and patient selection. Individual-patient-data meta-analysis of high-quality inception studies with long-term follow-up would be the optimal way to investigate the factors influencing mortality. © 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are currently two million cancer survivors in the United Kingdom, and in recent years this number has grown by 3\% per annum. The aim of this paper is to provide long-term projections of cancer prevalence in the United Kingdom. METHODS: National cancer registry data for England were used to estimate cancer prevalence in the United Kingdom in 2009. Using a model of prevalence as a function of incidence, survival and population demographics, projections were made to 2040. Different scenarios of future incidence and survival, and their effects on cancer prevalence, were also considered. Colorectal, lung, prostate, female breast and all cancers combined (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were analysed separately. RESULTS: Assuming that existing trends in incidence and survival continue, the number of cancer survivors in the United Kingdom is projected to increase by approximately one million per decade from 2010 to 2040. Particularly large increases are anticipated in the oldest age groups, and in the number of long-term survivors. By 2040, almost a quarter of people aged at least 65 will be cancer survivors. CONCLUSION: Increasing cancer survival and the growing/ageing population of the United Kingdom mean that the population of survivors is likely to grow substantially in the coming decades, as are the related demands upon the health service. Plans must, therefore, be laid to ensure that the varied needs of cancer survivors can be met in the future.},

Although prehypertension is a risk factor for hypertension, little is known of prehypertension's independent risk for mortality. We conducted an analysis of a nationally representative cohort in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1976 to 1980 (NHANES II) and the NHANES II Mortality Study, 1992. The cohort included 9,087 patients aged 30 to 74 years at baseline, who represented nearly 95 million Americans. Cox proportional-hazards models were conducted for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. The unadjusted relative risk of both all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] 1.27, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.58) and CVD (HR 1.66, 95\% CI 1.21 to 2.26) mortality is increased for patients with prehypertension over patients with normal blood pressure (BP). Almost all patients with hypertension (93\%), prehypertension (90\%), and normal BP (85\%) have other CVD risk factors. When the presence of any CVD risk factor is adjusted for in the survival analysis, the adjusted relative risk of both all-cause (HR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.04) and CVD (HR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.72 to 1.39) mortality is no longer increased for patients with prehypertension. Similarly, in analyses of patients aged ≥55 years, there is no significant independent mortality risk for prehypertension. Lifestyle interventions targeting multiple risk factors including BP may be the most effective prevention strategy.},

Data from four waves (1998–2001) of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) were used; a standardized multipurpose annual longitudinal survey. Self-reported health and socioeconomic information was collected repeatedly using uniform questionnaires for 66,331 individuals in nine countries. Health status was measured in terms of disability in daily activities. Multistate Markov (MSM) models were applied to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and age-specific transition rates according to BMI and smoking status. Multistate life tables were computed using the predicted transition probabilities to estimate LE and LwD. Significant associations were observed between disability incidence and BMI (HR = 1.15 for overweight, HR = 1.64 for obese, compared to normal weight). The risk of mortality was negatively associated with overweight status among disabled (HR = 0.77). Overweight people had higher LE than people with normal-weight and obesity. Among women, overweight and obese nonsmokers expect 3.6 and 6.1 more years of LwD than normal weight persons, respectively. In contrast, daily smokers expect lower LE but a similar LwD. The same patterns were observed among people with high education and those with low education. To conclude, daily smoking is associated with mortality more than with disability, whereas obesity is associated with disability more than with mortality. The findings suggest that further tobacco control would contribute to increasing LE, while tackling the obesity epidemic is necessary to prevent an expansion of disability.},

Among older adult LT recipients, short-term outcomes in the MELD era were comparable to the pre-MELD era, but long-term outcomes remain unclear. Material/Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using the UNOS data on patients age ≥50 years who underwent primary LT from February 27, 2002 until October 31, 2011. Results A total of 35,686 recipients met inclusion criteria. The cohort was divided into 5-year interval age groups. Five-year over-all survival rates for ages 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, and 70+ were 72.2\%, 71.6\%, 69.5\%, 65.0\%, and 57.5\%, respectively. Five-year graft survival rates after adjusting for death as competing risk for ages 50–54, 55–59,60–64, 65–69 and 70+ were 85.8\%, 87.3\%, 89.6\%, 89.1\% and 88.9\%, respectively. By Cox proportional hazard modeling, age ≥60, increasing MELD, donor age ≥60, hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), dialysis and impaired pre-transplant functional status (FS) were associated with increased 5-year mortality. Using Fine and Gray sub-proportional hazard modeling adjusted for death as competing risk, 5-year graft failure was associated with donor age ≥60, increasing MELD, hepatitis C, HCC, and impaired pre-transplant FS. Conclusions Among older LT recipients in the MELD era, long-term graft survival after adjusting for death as competing risk was improved with increasing age, while over-all survival was worse. Donor age, hepatitis C, and pre-transplant FS represent potentially modifiable risk factors that could influence long-term graft and patient survival.},

The aim of this study was to analyze whether the pulmonary function tests and the more commonly used markers of activity, such as serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) and gallium-67 scan, are helpful to evaluate the prognosis of sarcoidosis, besides the clinical data. Over a 14-year period (1974-1987), 209 patients were diagnosed as having sarcoidosis at the Bellvitge Hospital, a 1,000-bed teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Clinical, radiological, pulmonary function tests, and activity markers (SACE and gallium-67 scan) data at diagnosis were collected and classified as variables, and a definition of disease activity was established. One hundred sixteen patients were on follow-up, had all the variables available and were included in the statistical analysis. A Cox proportional-hazard regression model identified the following variables as independently influencing the persistence of activity over time: absence of erythema nodosum [risk ratio (RR) = 2.78; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.48-5.18], age ≥40 years (RR = 1.67; 95\% CI: 1.008-1.04), SACE level ≥ mean + 2 SDU/ml(RR= 1.45; CI: 0.99-1.07), hyperglobulinemia (RR = 2.47; CI: 0.98-6.24), forced vital capacity {$<$} 80\% predicted (RR = 2.17; CI: 0.97-4.85), and male sex (RR = 1.8; CI: 0.95-3.45). We conclude that the pulmonary function tests and the SACE level but not the gallium scan are helpful to identify the factors predicting persistence of activity in sarcoidosis. Therefore, we recommend to add these tests to the initial clinical evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis in order to establish the prognosis and improve the therapeutic approach.},

  abstract = {The prognosis of sarcoidosis is difficult to establish and it depends mainly on the persistence of activity over time and the degree of functional impairment of the involved organs. The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting persistence of disease activity at diagnosis. In a 14-year period (1974-1987), 209 patients were diagnosed with sarcoidosis at Bellvitge Hospital, a 1,000-bed teaching institution in Barcelona, Spain. One hundred ninety-three patients were followed up and included in the study. Clinical and radiological data were collected at diagnosis and a definition of disease activity was established. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model identified the following variables as independently influencing the persistence of activity: absence of erythema nodosum (risk ratio, RR = 2.37; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 1.54-3.66), pulmonary infiltrates in chest x-ray (RR=1.89, 95\% CI: 1.28-2.8), splenomegaly (RR = 3.67, 95\% CI: 1.46-9.23), age ≥40 years (RR =1.01, 95\% CI: 1.006-1.03), and absence of lymphadenopathy in chest x-ray (RR = 2.26, 95\% CI: 1.08–4.77). We suggest that the identification of factors predicting persistence of sarcoidosis activity at diagnosis may help to establish the prognosis of the disease and therefore improve the therapeutic approach.},

We evaluated the long-term mortality risk of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in a well-defined population. METHODS: The data were based on a prospective IBD register in our catchment area; follow-up covered 1986-2007. The population based cohort comprised 1915 adult patients, 1254 with UC, 550 with CD, and 111 with inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU). The mortality rate and causes of death were obtained from Statistics Finland. RESULTS: We recorded 223 deaths among the 1915 patients with IBD within a follow-up of 29,644 person-years. The standardised mortality rate (SMR) was 1.14 in CD and 0.90 in UC. In cause-specific mortality; the risk of death in diseases of the digestive system was significantly increased in CD (SMR 5.38). The mortality in colorectal cancer was non-significantly increased in both UC and CD (SMR 1.80 and 1.88, respectively). Compared to the background population, there were significantly fewer deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (0 observed, 10.2 expected in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality in CD and CU was not different from that in the population. In cause-specific mortality, diseases of the digestive system were significantly increased. Deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders resulting from alcohol consumption were less common in patients with IBD than in the population at large in Finland.},

  abstract = {Objective As patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have more than 2.5-fold increased mortality risk, we sought to investigate the impact of tobacco smoking on the risk of premature death and its contribution to the excess mortality in MS patients. Methods We studied 1032 patients during the period 1994–2013 in a UK-based register. Cox regression model was used to investigate the impact of smoking on the risk of premature death, controlling for confounders. Smoking-specific mortality rates were compared with the UK general population. Results Of 923 patients with clinically definite MS, 80 (46 males and 34 females) had died by December 2012. HRs for death in current smokers and ex-smokers relative to never smokers were 2.70 (95\% CI 1.59 to 4.58, p{$<$}0.001) and 1.30 (95\% CI 0.72 to 2.32; p = 0.37). The standardised mortality ratio, compared with the UK general population, when stratified by smoking status was 3.83 (95\% CI 2.71 to 5.42) in current smokers, 1.96 (95\% CI 1.27 to 3.0) in ex-smokers and 1.27 (95\% CI 0.87 to 1.86) in non-smokers. Never smokers and ex-smokers with MS had similar mortality rates compared with never smokers and ex-smokers without MS in the male British doctors cohort (1.12 (95\% CI 0.63 to 1.97) and 0.54 (95\% CI 0.26 to 1.14), respectively), while current smokers with MS had 84\% higher rate of death compared with current smokers without MS (95\% CI 1.24 to 2.72). Conclusions Tobacco smoking can account for some of the excess mortality associated with MS and is a risk determinant for all-cause and MS-related death.},

In addition, an excess mortality among underweight subjects has been observed in previous studies. METHODS Five complete birth-year cohorts (1926-1930) of male residents in Malmö (n = 7697) were invited to the survey at the Department of Preventive Medicine, Malmö General Hospital, and 5926 (77\%) attended with complete data. Each subject was followed from inclusion, defined by the date of examination, until the end of the calendar year when he turned 58, a total study period of approximately 11 years. Data on about 300 questionnaire items and laboratory tests were determined at the health survey visit. Nationwide Swedish data registers were used for surveillance. RESULTS Of the participants, 4.7\% were underweight, 37.7\% overweight, 7.3\% obese and 50.3\% normal weight; 849 (14.3\%) had been granted disability pension at the end of follow-up, 717 after screening. After adjustment for smoking there was a J-shaped relation between body mass index (BMI) and incidence of disability pension, the relative risk ( with the normal group as reference) among underweight men being 1.9. For the overweight subjects it was 1.3 and for the obese 2.8, all differences were significant. Disease of the musculoskeletal and circulatory systems and mental disorders accounted for 67.2\% of all main diagnoses resulting in disability pensions during follow-up. A total of 377 (6.4\%) men died during follow-up. Diseases of the circulatory system, neoplasms, injury/poisoning and diseases of the respiratory system accounted for 91.8\% of the deaths. CONCLUSIONS Both underweight, overweight and obesity were related to risk of disability pension, with a J-shaped risk relationship.},

APRI has been used for predicting liver-related mortality in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection or alcoholic liver disease. However, whether APRI could be useful for predicting mortality in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains unevaluated. This study aims to address this knowledge gap., A total of 193 hospitalized chronic HBV-infected patients (cirrhosis, n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}100; noncirrhosis, n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}93) and 88 healthy subjects were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were followed up for 4 months. Mortality that occurred within 90 days of hospital stay was compared among patients with different APRI. APRI predictive value was evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression embedded in a Cox proportional hazards model., APRI varied significantly in our cohort (range, 0.16–10.00). Elevated APRI was associated with increased severity of liver disease and 3-month mortality in hospitalized patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that APRI (odds ratio: 1.456, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001) and the model for end-stage liver disease score (odds ratio: 1.194, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001) were 2 independent markers for predicting mortality., APRI is a simple marker that may serve as an additional predictor of 3-month mortality in hospitalized patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.},

SPSS statistical software was used to analyze the data. Data from 896 patients with COPD were analyzed. Bronchiectasis was present in 311 patients. The isolation of pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) from sputum was the variable most significantly associated with the presence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD (hazard ratio (HR), 2.93; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.35–6.37; P\,=\,0.007). During follow-up (median of 21 months; interquartile range: 10-39 months), there were 75 deaths, of which 39 were in the bronchiectasis group. The presence of bronchiectasis (HR, 1.77; 95\% CI, 1.02–3.08; P\,=\,0.043) was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality in patients with COPD. These results suggest that bronchiectasis in patients with COPD was associated with the isolation of PA from the sputum.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Excess body-mass index (BMI) has been associated with adverse outcomes in prostate cancer, and hyperinsulinaemia is a candidate mediator, but prospective data are sparse. We assessed the effect of prediagnostic BMI and plasma C-peptide concentration (reflecting insulin secretion) on prostate cancer-specific mortality after diagnosis. METHODS This study involved men diagnosed with prostate cancer during the 24 years of follow-up in the Physicians' Health Study. BMI measurements were available at baseline in 1982 and eight years later in 1990 for 2546 men who developed prostate cancer. Baseline C-peptide concentration was available in 827 men. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for age, smoking, time between BMI measurement and prostate cancer diagnosis, and competing causes of death to assess the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality according to BMI and C-peptide concentration. FINDINGS Of the 2546 men diagnosed with prostate cancer during the follow-up period, 989 (38.8\%) were overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) and 87 (3.4\%) were obese (BMI {$>$}/=30 kg/m(2)). 281 men (11\%) died from prostate cancer during this follow-up period. Compared with men of a healthy weight (BMI {$<$}25 kg/m(2)) at baseline, overweight men and obese men had a significantly higher risk of prostate cancer mortality (proportional hazard ratio [HR] 1.47 [95\% CI 1.16-1.88] for overweight men and 2.66 [1.62-4.39] for obese men; p(trend){$<$}0.0001). The trend remained significant after controlling for clinical stage and Gleason grade and was stronger for prostate cancer diagnosed during the PSA screening era (1991-2007) compared with during the pre-PSA screening era (1982-1990) or when using BMI measurements obtained in 1990 compared with those obtained in 1982. Of the 827 men with data available for baseline C-peptide concentration, 117 (14\%) died from prostate cancer. Men with C-peptide concentrations in the highest quartile (high) versus the lowest quartile (low) had a higher risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR 2.38 [95\% CI 1.31-4.30]; p(trend)=0.008). Compared with men with a BMI less than 25 kg/m(2) and low C-peptide concentrations, those with a BMI of 25 kg/m(2) or more and high C-peptide concentrations had a four-times higher risk of mortality (4.12 [1.97-8.61]; p(interaction)=0.001) independent of clinical predictors. INTERPRETATION Excess bodyweight and a high plasma concentration of C-peptide both predispose men with a subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer to an increased likelihood of dying of their disease. Patients with both factors have the worst outcome. Further studies are now needed to confirm these findings.},

Data from 9,579 participants without lung cancer were extracted from the Liverpool Lung Project between 1999 and 2010 and linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics database. The occurrence of comorbidities was assessed one year prior to the individual inclusion date. CCI scores were computed and Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between comorbidity and lung cancer mortality using a competitive risk approach. During a median follow-up of 11 years, 1,320/9,579 (13.7\%) individuals developed lung cancer, of which 886 (67.1\%) succumbed to lung cancer and 875 of the 9,579 individuals (9.1\%) succumbed due to other causes. The severity of comorbidity was associated with higher lung cancer-specific mortality; low to moderate comorbidity exhibited a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.86 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.17–7.02] and severe comorbidity exhibited an HR of 5.16 (95\% CI, 2.07–12.89). Furthermore, the CCI score determined that the severity of comorbidity increased the risk of lung cancer-specific mortality. Thus, CCI score is a good predictor of lung cancer-specific mortality and the use of comorbidity burdens in the clinical management of lung cancer is recommended.},

Methods and Results We included 199 patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AVA ≤1.0~cm2). The risk of events (death or need for aortic valve replacement) increased linearly on the scale of log hazard with decreased AVA (adjusted hazard ratio 1.17; 95\% CI 1.06–1.29 per 0.1~cm2 AVA decrement; P=0.002). Event‐free survival at 12, 24, and 48 months was 63±6\%, 51±6\%, and 34±6\%, respectively, for AVA 0.8 to 1~cm2; 49±6\%, 36±6\%, and 26±6\%, respectively, for AVA 0.6 to 0.8~cm2; and 33±8\%, 20±7\%, and 11±5\%, respectively, for AVA ≤0.6~cm2 (P trend=0.002). Patients with AVA ≤0.6~cm2 had a significantly increased risk of events compared with patients with AVA 0.8 to 1~cm2 (adjusted hazard ratio 2.22; 95\% CI 1.41–3.52; P=0.001), whereas patients with AVA 0.6 to 0.8~cm2 had an increased risk of events compared with those with AVA 0.8 to 1~cm2, but the difference was not statistically significant (adjusted hazard ratio 1.38; 95\% CI 0.93–2.05; P=0.11).

Conclusions Patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis and AVA ≤0.6~cm2 displayed an important increase in the risk of adverse events during short‐term follow‐up.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Thickness is known to be an important survival prognosticator for cutaneous melanoma, but controversy exists as to whether Clark level of invasion retains prognostic significance once thickness has been accounted for. A recent proposal to eliminate Clark level from the staging system for melanoma of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) prompted the authors to investigate whether level adds useful prognostic information to Breslow thickness. They used the data base of the New York University Melanoma Cooperative Group (NYU-MCG) Registry. METHODS The analysis was based on 919 patients with AJCC Stage I or II melanomas diagnosed between 1972 and 1982 and followed for an average of 10.9 years. Melanoma thicknesses were divided into 4 categories (≤0.75, 0.76–1.50, 1.51–4.00, and {$>$}4.00 mm). Patients were cross-classified according to tumor thickness and Clark level (II–V). For each combination of thickness and level, the Kaplan–Meier survival curve and 10-year survival proportion were computed, using death from melanoma as the outcome. The impact of Clark level on survival was evaluated for each of the thickness categories. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the simultaneous effect of thickness and level on survival while controlling for other important prognostic factors, i.e., age, tumor location, and presence or absence of ulceration. RESULTS Level of invasion was a significant predictor of death from melanoma in each of the four thickness categories. Likewise, in the Cox analyses, level was a significant prognostic variable, even after thickness was included in the model and regardless of whether thickness was treated as a categoric or a continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS These results confirm that both tumor thickness and level of invasion are important independent prognostic factors in AJCC Stage I and II melanomas. The authors recommend that Clark levels be kept as criteria in the AJCC staging system and be included in pathology reports.

Poisson regression was used to model mortality rates by age, diabetes duration and calendar time, according to sex.In the period 2002-2010, a total of 673 deaths (402 men, 271 women) occurred in the study population during 33,847 years of follow-up of type 1 diabetes. The predominant cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes was cardiovascular disease. Mortality rates were highest among those with the lowest age at onset, particularly men. The mortality rate in the diabetic population decreased over that time period by 6.6\% and 4.8\% per year in men and women, respectively; this was substantially greater than the decrease in mortality rates in the background population. The decline in standard mortality rate was 4.3\% per year in men and 2.6\% per year in women. Patients who did not develop nephropathy had only slightly elevated mortality rates compared with the background population.Despite advances in care, mortality rates in the past decade continue to be greater in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those without diabetes; however, the mortality rate in patients decreased over the study period faster than that of the background population. Nephropathy seems to be the main driver of the excess mortality.},

Smoking cessation among asbestos-exposed cohorts has been little studied.Objectives: To measure the contributions of asbestos exposure, asbestosis, smoking, and their interactions to lung cancer risk in an asbestos-exposed cohort and to describe their reduction in lung cancer risk when they stop smoking.Methods: We examined lung cancer mortality obtained through the National Death Index for 1981 to 2008 for 2,377 male North American insulators for whom chest X-ray, spirometric, occupational, and smoking data were collected in 1981 to 1983 and for 54,243 non–asbestos-exposed blue collar male workers from Cancer Prevention Study II for whom occupational and smoking data were collected in 1982.Measurements and Main Results: Lung cancer caused 339 (19\%) insulator deaths. Lung cancer mortality was increased by asbestos exposure alone among nonsmokers (rate ratio = 3.6 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.7–7.6]), by asbestosis among nonsmokers (rate ratio = 7.40 [95\% CI, 4.0–13.7]), and by smoking without asbestos exposure (rate ratio = 10.3 [95\% CI, 8.8–12.2]). The joint effect of smoking and asbestos alone was additive (rate ratio = 14.4 [95\% CI, 10.7–19.4]) and with asbestosis, supra-additive (rate ratio = 36.8 [95\% CI, 30.1–45.0]). Insulator lung cancer mortality halved within 10 years of smoking cessation and converged with that of never-smokers 30 years after smoking cessation.Conclusions: Asbestos increases lung cancer mortality among nonsmokers. Asbestosis further increases the lung cancer risk and, considered jointly with smoking, has a supra-additive effect. Insulators benefit greatly by quitting smoking.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study was designed to clarify and resolve the clinical profile of older patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Background Adverse consequences of HCM such as sudden death and incapacitating symptoms have been emphasized for the young and middle-aged. Methods Long-term outcome of HCM was assessed in a community-based cohort not subject to tertiary center referral bias. Results Of 312 patients, 73 (23\%) achieved normal life expectancy (≥75 years; range to 96); 44 (14\%) were ≥80 years old. Most patients ≥75 years (47; 64\%) experienced no or only mild limiting symptoms and lived virtually their entire lives with few HCM-related clinical consequences; 26 patients (36\%) experienced severe progressive symptoms. In elderly patients with HCM, diagnosis and symptom onset were considerably delayed to 74 ± 8 and 70 ± 11 years, respectively. For patients ≥50 years at diagnosis, the probability of survival for 5, 10, and 15 years was 85 ± 3\%, 74 ± 4\%, and 57 ± 6\%, respectively, and did not significantly differ from a matched general population (p = 0.20). Patients ≥75 years were predominantly women, and had less marked wall thickness and more frequently showed basal outflow obstruction ≥30 mm Hg (compared with those {$<$}75 years; p {$<$} 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). Conclusions Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is frequently well tolerated and compatible with normal life expectancy, and may remain clinically dormant for long periods of time with symptoms and initial diagnosis deferred until late in life. These observations afford a measure of reassurance to many patients with HCM, a disease for which clinical course is often unfavorable and unpredictable.},

  abstract = {Background—Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is prominently associated with risk for sudden death and disease progression, largely in young patients. Whether patients of more advanced age harbor similar risks is unresolved, often creating clinical dilemmas, particularly in decisions for primary prevention of sudden death with implantable defibrillators. Methods and Results—We studied 428 consecutive HCM patients presenting at ≥60 years of age and followed for 5.8±4.8 years; 53\% were women. Of the 428 patients, 279 (65\%) survived to 73±7 years of age (range, 61–96 years), most (n=245, 88\%) with no/mild symptoms, including 135 with ≥1 conventional sudden death risk factors and 50 (37\%) with late gadolinium enhancement. Over follow-up, 149 (35\%) died at 80±8 years of age, mostly from non–HCM-related causes (n=133, 31\%), including a substantial proportion from noncardiac disease (n=54). Sixteen patients (3.7\%) had HCM-related mortality events (0.64\%/y), including embolic stroke (n=6), progressive heart failure or transplantation (n=3), postoperative complications (n=2), and arrhythmic sudden death events (n=5, 1.2\% [0.20\%/y]). All-cause mortality was increased in HCM patients ≥60 years of age compared with an age-matched US general population, predominantly as a result of non–HCM-related diseases (P{$<$}0.001; standard mortality ratio, 1.5). Conclusions—HCM patients surviving into the seventh decade of life are at low risk for disease-related morbidity/mortality, including sudden death, even with conventional risk factors. These data do not support aggressive prophylactic defibrillator implantation at advanced ages in HCM. Other cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities have a greater impact on survival than HCM in older patients.},

  abstract = {Bronchiectasis is a multidimensional disease and, therefore, its severity or prognosis cannot be adequately quantified by analysing one single variable. The objective of the present study was to develop a multidimensional score that classifies the severity of bronchiectasis according to its prognosis. This is an observational multicentre study including 819 patients diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis using high-resolution computed tomography. 397 subjects were selected at random to construct the score while the remaining 422 were used for its validation. The outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality after radiological diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis was used to select the variables included in the final score. The final seven-point score incorporated five dichotomised variables: forced expiratory volume in 1 s \% predicted (F, cut-off 50\%, maximum value 2 points); age (A, cut-off 70 years, maximum value 2 points); presence of chronic colonisation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (C, dichotomic, maximum value 1 point); radiological extension (E, number of lobes affected, cut-off two lobes, maximum value 1 point); and dyspnoea (D, cut-off grade II on the Medical Research Council scale, maximum value 1 point) to construct the FACED score. The validation cohort confirmed the score’s validity. We conclude that this easy-to-use multidimensional grading system proved capable of accurately classifying the severity of bronchiectasis according to its prognosis.

Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to investigate risk factors for all-cause mortality. Risk factors examined included demographics, body mass index, physiologic data, quality of life, dyspnea, oxygen utilization, hemoglobin, smoking history, quantitative emphysema markers on computed tomography, and a modification of a recently described multifunctional index (modified BODE)., Results: Overall, high mortality was seen in this cohort (12.7 deaths per 100 person-years; 292 total deaths). In multivariate analyses, increasing age (p = 0.001), oxygen utilization (p = 0.04), lower total lung capacity \% predicted (p = 0.05), higher residual volume \% predicted (p = 0.04), lower maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing workload (p = 0.002), greater proportion of emphysema in the lower lung zone versus the upper lung zone (p = 0.005), and lower upper-to-lower-lung perfusion ratio (p = 0.007), and modified BODE (p = 0.02) were predictive of mortality. FEV1 was a significant predictor of mortality in univariate analysis (p = 0.005), but not in multivariate analysis (p = 0.21)., Conclusion: Although patients with advanced emphysema experience significant mortality, subgroups based on age, oxygen utilization, physiologic measures, exercise capacity, and emphysema distribution identify those at increased risk of death.},

  abstract = {This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a stochastic mortality model that is intended to support shared decision-making between health care professionals and patients; health care planning; and actuarial analysis for life insurance, health insurance and pensions. The model uses risk factors and cause of death to calculate all-cause mortality in a modularised Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. This modularisation allows the substitution of different cause of death models and hazard ratios, enabling customisation, calibration to different populations, and further research. The cause-specific sub-models used in this evaluation incorporate a method of auto-calibration to different populations using baseline population mortality rates, risk factor distributions, and individual risk factor values. The model can investigate the impact of changing trends in risk factors and population mortality rates. Trends in lifestyle factors such as smoking cessation, medical interventions that adjust risk factors such as blood pressure or serum cholesterol reduction, or interventions that reduce mortality from specific causes, can be examined. Non-specific, observed trends like the select transition effect seen in life insurance portfolios, or cohort effects relating to year of birth, can also be applied. A thorough internal and external evaluation of the model is presented, including its performance in simulating three randomised controlled trials (two of the treatment of hypertension, and one of cholesterol reduction in subjects experiencing a cardiovascular event), as well as three simulations of historical prospective cohort data projected over at least 16 years. A demonstration of the application of the model in the assessment of the impact of changing trends in obesity rates in the UK over the next 50 years suggests that rising obesity makes a modest negative contribution to mortality improvement, but not enough to reverse current improvement rates.},

Studies also suggest that high levels of insulin and leptin increase sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and engender increased chronotropy, vasoconstriction and antinatriuresis that may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity related hypertension. Sympathetic modulation of cardiovascular responses requires good baroreceptor sensitivity and optimal vascular compliance. The vascular changes associated with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) have been shown to modify baroreceptor sensitivity and vascular compliance and may mitigate sympathetic modulation of cardiovascular responses and attenuate the hypertensive effect of obesity. The purpose of this study is to examine the differences in the relationship between body mass index, pulse rate (PR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) among participants with normal blood pressure and ISH using data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Data from 13,761 non-institutionalized adults 18 years and older not receiving antihypertensive therapy were analyzed. Results showed that PR, SBP and DBP increase with increasing BMI. The rise in PR, SBP and DBP with BMI is higher among participants with normal blood pressure than among those with ISH. We concluded that increasing level of obesity is associated with a rise in pulse rate and blood pressure but the effect of obesity on blood pressure and pulse rate might be weaker among participants with ISH.},

DESIGN: Crossover, clinical intervention where participants consumed 300-kcal loads of a solid (apple), semisolid (apple sauce), and beverage (apple juice) at a meal or 2 hours later (snack). SUBJECTS: Twenty normal-weight (body mass index 22.6+/-1.8) and 20 obese (body mass index 32.3+/-1.5) adults. There were 10 men and 10 women within each body mass index group. MEASUREMENTS: On six occasions, participants reported to the laboratory at their customary midday mealtime. Appetite questionnaires and motor skills tests were completed upon arrival and at 30-minute intervals for the 2 hours participants were in the laboratory and at 30-minute intervals for 4 hours after leaving the laboratory. Diet recalls were collected the next day. Data were collected between January 2006 and March 2007. RESULTS: Whether consumed with a meal or alone as a snack, the beverage elicited the weakest appetitive response, the solid food form elicited the strongest appetitive response and the semisolid response was intermediate. The appetite shift was greatest for the solid food when consumed as a snack. The interval between test food consumption and the first spontaneous eating event {$>$}100 kcal was shortest for the beverage. No significant treatment effects were observed for test day energy intake or between lean individuals and individuals with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the appetitive findings, consumption of an energy-yielding beverage either with a meal or as a snack poses a greater risk for promoting positive energy than macronutrient-matched semisolid or solid foods consumed at these times.},

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. Baseline predictors were patient demographics, a seven-item questionnaire on functional status and general health, use of five or more drugs, and previous hospitalization. SETTING: Community-based study. PARTICIPANTS: Prognostic indexes were developed in 2,470 subjects and validated in 2,926 subjects, all community-dwelling, aged 65 and older, and randomly sampled from the rosters of 98 PCPs in Florence, Italy. MEASUREMENTS: Fifteen-month mortality and hospitalization. RESULTS: Two scores were derived from logistic regression models and used to stratify participants into four groups. With Model 1, based upon the seven-item questionnaire, mortality rate ranged from 0.8\% in the lowest-risk group (0-1 point) to 9.4\% in the highest risk group ({$>$} or = 3 points), and hospitalization rate ranged from 12.4\% to 29.3\%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was 0.75 and 0.60, respectively. With Model 2, considering also drug use and previous hospitalization, mortality and hospitalization rates ranged from 0.3\% to 8.2\% and from 8.1\% to 29.7\%, for the lowest-risk to the highest-risk group; the AUC increased significantly only for hospitalization (0.67). CONCLUSION: Prediction of death and hospitalization in older community-dwelling people can be easily obtained with two indexes using information promptly available to PCPs. These tools might be useful for guiding clinical care and targeting interventions to reduce the need for hospital care in older persons.},

The goal of this study was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT) mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5\%, 86.0\% and 77.5\% for nonfrail, intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95\% CI: 1.01–4.65, p = 0.047) higher risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.},

  abstract = {Objectives Among persons with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), we determined whether objective measures of walking performance predict mortality independently of the ankle brachial index (ABI). Background The ability of office-based functional performance measures to predict mortality in patients with PAD is unknown. Methods Participants were 444 persons with PAD followed prospectively for 4.8 years. The 6-min walk and 4-m walks at usual and fastest pace were measured at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess relations between baseline measures of lower extremity performance with mortality, adjusting for confounders. Results One hundred twenty-seven patients (28.6\%) died during follow-up. Adjusting for age, gender, race, comorbidities, ABI, and other confounders, participants in the poorest baseline quartile of 6-min walk performance had significantly increased total mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.36 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.33 to 4.18]) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 5.59 [95\% CI 1.97 to 15.9]) compared with the best quartile of baseline performance. Participants in the poorest baseline quartile of normal-paced 4-m walking speed had significantly increased total mortality (HR 1.86 [95\% CI 1.06 to 3.29]) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.55 [95\% CI 1.01 to 6.46]) compared with the best quartile of baseline performance. Conclusions This study demonstrates for the first time that performance-based measures, which can be administered in an office setting, provide prognostic information regarding mortality in persons with PAD beyond that provided by the ABI.},

  abstract = {Background Patients with bronchiectasis often suffer from concurrent comorbidities but their nature, prevalence and impact on disease severity and outcome is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate comorbidities in bronchiectasis patients and determine their prognostic value on disease severity and mortality. Methods An observational cohort analysis of 986 bronchiectasis patients across four European centres was performed for score derivation. Comorbidity diagnoses were based on standardised definitions obtained on full review of hard copy and electronic records, prescriptions and investigator definitions. Weibull parametric survival analysis was used to model the prediction of 5-year mortality to construct the Bronchiectasis Aetiology Comorbidity Index (BACI). We tested the BACI as a predictor of outcomes and explored whether the BACI added further prognostic information when used alongside the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI). Findings Median number of comorbidities per patient was 4 (IQR 2-6), range 0-20. Thirteen comorbidities independently predicting mortality were integrated into the BACI. The overall hazard ratio for death conferred by a one point increase in the BACI was 1.18 (1.14-1.23), p{$<$}0.0001. The BACI predicted 5-year mortality, hospitalisations, exacerbations and health-related quality of life across all BSI risk strata (p{$<$}0.0001). When used in conjunction with the BSI, the combined model was superior to either model alone. The BACI was validated in two independent international cohorts. Interpretation Multimorbidity is frequent in bronchiectasis and can negatively influence survival. The BACI complements the BSI in assessing mortality and disease outcomes in patients with bronchiectasis. Funding 1. European Bronchiectasis Network (EMBARC).2. Health Research Board Ireland.},

Two disease-specific clinical prediction tools have been developed, the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and the FACED score, both of which stratify patients into severity risk categories to predict the probability of mortality. Methods We aimed to compare the predictive utility of BSI and FACED in assessing clinically relevant disease outcomes across seven European cohorts independent of their original validation studies. Results The combined cohorts totalled 1612. Pooled analysis showed that both scores had a good discriminatory predictive value for mortality (pooled area under the curve (AUC) 0.76, 95\% CI 0.74 to 0.78 for both scores) with the BSI demonstrating a higher sensitivity (65\% vs 28\%) but lower specificity (70\% vs 93\%) compared with the FACED score. Calibration analysis suggested that the BSI performed consistently well across all cohorts, while FACED consistently overestimated mortality in ‘severe’ patients (pooled OR 0.33 (0.23 to 0.48), p{$<$}0.0001). The BSI accurately predicted hospitalisations (pooled AUC 0.82, 95\% CI 0.78 to 0.84), exacerbations, quality of life (QoL) and respiratory symptoms across all risk categories. FACED had poor discrimination for hospital admissions (pooled AUC 0.65, 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.67) with low sensitivity at 16\% and did not consistently predict future risk of exacerbations, QoL or respiratory symptoms. No association was observed with FACED and 6\hspace{0.25em}min walk distance (6MWD) or lung function decline. Conclusion The BSI accurately predicts mortality, hospital admissions, exacerbations, QoL, respiratory symptoms, 6MWD and lung function decline in bronchiectasis, providing a clinically relevant evaluation of disease severity.},

  abstract = {Diabetes-related foot complications, including foot ulceration (DFU), Charcot neuroosteoarthropathy (CN), and lower extremity amputation are severely debilitating conditions. Previous studies have shown that diabetes-related foot complications increase the risk of mortality. Our objective was to study the impact of foot complications on 10 year mortality independent of other demographic and biological risk factors in a racially and socioeconomically diverse managed care population with high quality of care. We studied 6,692 patients with diabetes in Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD), a prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care. Foot complications were assessed using administrative claims data. The National Death Index was searched for deaths over 10 years of followup (2000-2009). At baseline, the 3 year period prevalence of CN was 55 cases (1\%), DFU with debridement was 205 cases (3\%), and amputation with, or without, DFU was 101 cases (2\%). Over 10 years, 29\% of participants died. CN and DFU with debridement were associated with an increased risk of mortality; however the association was not significant in fully adjusted models. Amputation was associated with an increased risk of mortality in both unadjusted (HR 3.2, 95\% CI 2.50-4.12) and fully adjusted models (HR 1.84, 95\% CI 1.28-2.63). When examining the associations by sex and race, the increased risk was in males (HR 1.96, 95\% CI 1.25-3.07), Hispanics (HR 5.17, 95\% CI 1.48-18.01), and Whites (HR 2.18, 95\% CI 1.37- 3.47). In sensitivity analyses, minor amputations tended to increase the risk for mortality (HR 1.48, 95\% CI 0.92-2.40), and major amputations were associated with higher risk (HR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.18-3.01). In this managed care population, access to high quality care appeared to attenuate previously reported associations between black race and amputations. Amputation was a robust independent predictor of mortality.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: For this report, we examined the relationships between the conditions of being overweight and obese and mortality from all causes, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. METHODS: We defined the categories of body weight according to level of body mass index, BMI=wt(kg)/ht(m)2, using classifications suggested by the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. These classifications are as follows: "normal weight" is defined as BMI {$>$} or = 18.5, but less than 25; "overweight" equals BMI {$>$} or = 25, but less than 30; and "obese" individuals have BMIs {$>$} or = 30. Our investigation is based on person-level data from 26 observational studies that include both genders, several racial and ethnic groups, and samples from the US and other countries. The database consists of 74 analytic cohorts, arranged according to natural strata including gender, race, and area of residence. It includes 388,622 individuals, with 60,374 deaths during follow-up. We use proportional hazards models to examine the relationships between the BMI categories and mortality, controlling for age and smoking status. We use random-effects models to assess summary relative risks associated with the overweight and obesity conditions across cohorts. RESULTS: The relative risks among the heaviest individuals for overall death, death caused by coronary heart disease (CHD), and death caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) are 1.22, 1.57, and 1.48, respectively, when compared with the those within the lowest BMI category. The summary relative risk among the heaviest participants for death from cancer is 1.07. CONCLUSIONS: We document once again, excess mortality associated with obesity. Our results do, however, question whether the current classification of individuals as "overweight" is optimal in the sense, since there is little evidence of increased risk of mortality in this group},

  abstract = {In the past 25 years, major advances were achieved in the nosography of cardiomyopathies, influencing the definition and taxonomy of this important chapter of cardiovascular disease. Nearly, 50\% of patients dying suddenly in childhood or adolescence or undergoing cardiac transplantation are affected by cardiomyopathies. Novel cardiomyopathies have been discovered (arrhythmogenic, restrictive, and noncompacted) and added to update the World Health Organization classification. Myocarditis has also been named inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Extraordinary progress accomplished in molecular genetics of inherited cardiomyopathies allowed establishment of dilated cardiomyopathy as mostly cytoskeleton, force transmission disease; hypertrophic–restrictive cardiomyopathies as sarcomeric, force generation disease; and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy as desmosome, cell junction disease. Channelopathies (short and long QT, Brugada, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia syndromes) should also be considered cardiomyopathies because of electric myocyte dysfunction. Cardiomyopathies are easily diagnosed but treated only with palliative pharmacological or invasive therapy. Curative therapy, thanks to insights into the molecular pathogenesis, has to target the fundamental mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of these conditions.},

  abstract = {Background: Life expectancy has increased for newly diagnosed HIV patients since the inception of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART), but there remains a need to better understand the characteristics of long-term survival in HIV-positive patients. We examined long-term survival in HIV-positive patients receiving cART in the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD), to describe changes in mortality compared to the general population and to develop longer-term survival models. Methods: Data were examined from 2,675 HIV-positive participants in AHOD who started cART. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated by age, sex and calendar year across prognostic characteristics using Australian Bureau of Statistics national data as reference. SMRs were examined by years of duration of cART by CD4 and similarly by viral load. Survival was analysed using Cox-proportional hazards and parametric survival models. Results: The overall SMR for all-cause mortality was 3.5 (95\% CI: 3.0–4.0). SMRs by CD4 count were 8.6 (95\% CI: 7.2–10.2) for CD4,350 cells/ml; 2.1 (95\% CI: 1.5–2.9) for CD4 = 350–499 cells/ml; and 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.1–2.0) for CD4\$500 cells/ml. SMRs for patients with CD4 counts ,350 cells/mL were much higher than for patients with higher CD4 counts across all durations of cART. SMRs for patients with viral loads greater than 400 copies/ml were much higher across all durations of cART. Multivariate models demonstrated improved survival associated with increased recent CD4, reduced recent viral load, younger patients, absence of HBVsAg-positive ever, year of HIV diagnosis and incidence of ADI. Parametric models showed a fairly constant mortality risk by year of cART up to 15 years of treatment. Conclusion: Observed mortality remained fairly constant by duration of cART and was modelled accurately by accepted prognostic factors. These rates did not vary much by duration of treatment. Changes in mortality with age were similar to those in the Australian general population.},

Previous studies describe contradictory results and are restricted to one cardiovascular bed, while atherosclerosis is a systemic disease. We therefore studied the prognosis of women versus men in the SMART study, a large cohort of patients with clinically manifest atherosclerosis with extensive baseline and follow-up information.Methods:5349 patients (1347 women, 4002 men) with at least one type of atherosclerotic vascular disease (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease or abdominal aortic aneurysm) were included in the SMART study, an ongoing long-term follow-up study. They all received a standardized cardiovascular work-up with a personalized therapy advice. All future cardiovascular events were collected prospectively. All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular outcome (composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) were evaluated using Cox regression and expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI). Men served as the reference category. Different models were used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics.Results:Women and men had a mean age of 60 years and their median follow-up (range) was five years (13.5).The hazard ratios of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and cardiovascular outcome were 0.62 (95\%CI: 0.51?0.75), 0.59 (95\%CI: 0.46?0.75) and 0.73 (95\%CI: 0.60?0.87).

This investigation compared surgical outcomes of never and current smokers with NSCLC. Methods: This investigation was a single-institution retrospective study of never and current smokers with NSCLC from 1975 to 2004. From an analytic cohort of 4,546 patients with NSCLC, we identified 724 never smokers and 3,822 current smokers. Overall, 1,142 patients underwent surgery with curative intent. For survival analysis by smoking status, hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard modeling and then further adjusted by other covariates. Results: Never smokers were significantly more likely than current smokers to be women (P {$<$} .01), older (P {$<$} .01), and to have adenocarcinoma (P {$<$} .01) and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (P {$<$} .01). No statistically significant differences existed in stage distribution at presentation for the analytic cohort (P = .35) or for the subgroup undergoing surgery (P = .24). The strongest risk factors of mortality among patients with NSCLC who underwent surgery were advanced stage (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.43; 95\% CI, 2.32-5.07; P {$<$} .01) and elevated American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.40-3.40; P {$<$} .01). The minor trend toward an elevated risk of death on univariate analysis for current vs never smokers in the surgically treated group (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.46; P = .07) was completely eliminated when the model was adjusted for covariates (P = .97). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that smoking status at time of lung cancer diagnosis has little impact on the long-term survival of patients with NSCLC, especially after curative surgery. Despite different etiologies between lung cancer in never and current smokers the prognosis is equally dismal.},

Methods The population included 675 patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer whose medical information was abstracted from a hospital cancer registry. Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27, a validated instrument, was used to prospectively categorize comorbidity. Independent variables assessed include comorbidity, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, grade, age, gender, and race. Outcome measure was overall survival. We analyzed the entire cohort, patients with noninvasive disease, and patients requiring cystectomy. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess impact of independent variables on survival. Results Median age at diagnosis for the entire cohort was 71 yr and median follow-up was 45 mo. Of 675 patients, 446 had at least one comorbid condition and 301 died during follow-up. On multivariable analysis for the entire cohort, comorbidity (p = 0.0001), AJCC stage (p = 0.0001), age (p = 0.0001), and race (p = 0.0045) significantly predicted overall survival. On subset analysis of noninvasive bladder cancer patients, comorbidity (p = 0.0001) and age (p = 0.0001) independently predicted overall survival, whereas stage, grade, race, and gender did not. On subset analysis of cystectomy patients, comorbidity (p = 0.0053), stage (p = 0.0001), and race (p = 0.0449) significantly predicted overall survival. Conclusions Comorbidity is an independent predictor of overall survival in the entire cohort of bladder cancer patients, the subset with noninvasive disease, and the subset treated with cystectomy.},

This study aimed at analyzing their single and combined association with site-specific cancer mortality. Methods: Our study population comprised 35,784 men and women of ages 14 to 99 years, who participated in population-based health surveys conducted 1977–1993 in Switzerland and were followed up for mortality until 2008. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were calculated for different cancer sites, and population attributable fractions were derived. Results: The hazard ratio of dying from cancer (all sites) was 2.32 (95\% confidence interval, 2.04–2.63) for heavy smokers (vs. never smokers) and 1.15 (1.01–1.32) for obese [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2] vs. normal weight individuals. Heavy smoking (≥20 cigarettes/day) was associated with increased mortality due to cancer of the lung, upper aero-digestive tract, pancreas, bladder, liver, and the total of remaining sites. Obesity was associated with higher risk of dying from cancer of the liver and the female genital tract (essentially corpus or cervix uteri and ovary). More than 20\% of all cancer deaths in our population were attributable to ever smoking and overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2). Conclusions: Smoking was a much stronger risk factor for cancer than excess body weight. For lung, liver, and pancreatic cancer, the combination of excess body weight and smoking lead to cumulated higher risks. Impact: Our findings support recommendations for obese persons to quit smoking despite potential postcessation weight gain. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(10); 1516–22. ©2015 AACR.},

To analyse acute and long-term mortality, estimate life expectancy and identify survival patterns of individuals experiencing traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Specialised SCI unit in Australia. Data for patients with traumatic SCI admitted to a spinal unit in Sydney, Australia between January 1955 and June 2006 were collated and deaths confirmed. Cumulative survival probability was estimated using life-table techniques and mortality rates were calculated from the number of deaths and aggregate years of exposure. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated from the ratio of observed to expected number of deaths. Life expectancy was then estimated using adjusted attained age-specific mortality rates. From 2014 persons, 88 persons with tetraplegia (8.2\%) and 38 persons with paraplegia (4.1\%) died within 12 months of injury, most often with complete C1–4 tetraplegia. Among first-year survivors, overall 40-year survival rates were 47 and 62\% for persons with tetraplegia and paraplegia, respectively. The most significant increases in mortality were seen in those with tetraplegia and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades A–C lesions, with SMRs between 5.4 and 9.0 for people ⩽50 years, reducing with advancing attained age. Estimated life expectancies from 25 to 65 years ranged between 69–64\%, 74–65\%, 88–91\% and 97–96\% for C1–4 AIS A–C, C5–8 A–C, T1–S5 A–C and all AIS D lesions, respectively. Survival related strongly to extent of neurological impairment. Future research should focus on identifying contextual factors, personal or environmental, that may contribute to the reduced life expectancy after SCI.},

We studied a cohort of 1,529 patients with primary superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with transurethral resection and random bladder biopsies. Mean followup was 4.2 years. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was done with the Cox proportional hazards model with stepwise forward selection. All p values were 2-sided, with odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. Multiple tumors (odds ratio 2), tumor greater than 3 cm. (1.65) and carcinoma in situ (1.6) increased, whereas intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillations (0.39) decreased the risk of recurrence. Grade 3 disease (odds ratio 19.9), multiple tumors (1.9), tumor greater than 3 cm. (1.7) and carcinoma in situ (2.1) increased, whereas BCG (0.3) decreased the risk of progression. Grade 3 disease (odds ratio 14) and carcinoma in situ (odds ratio 3) increased the risk of disease specific mortality. Neither tumor stage nor dysplasia influenced tumor evolution. Multiple tumors, tumor greater than 3 cm. and intravesical BCG instillations were risk factors of recurrence and progression. Carcinoma in situ influenced recurrence, progression and disease specific mortality. Finally, the main predictor of progression and mortality was grade 3 disease.},

The prognostic factors of progression, mortality and recurrence were identified by multivariate analysis in a cohort of 1,529 patients with primary superficial bladder cancer. Risk groups were designed by combining the relative risk of these prognostic factors. We performed survival analysis of progression, tumor mortality and recurrence by risk group using the Kaplan-Meier method. Relative risk in each group was calculated by Cox regression. We present timetables of progression, mortality and recurrence by risk group. Risk groups were classified as low—grade 1 stage Ta disease and a single grade 1 stage T1 tumor, intermediate—multiple grade 1 stage T1 tumors, grade 2 stage Ta disease and a single grade 2 stage T1 tumor, and high—multiple grade 2 stage T1 tumors, grade 3 stages Ta and T1 disease, and any stage disease associated with carcinoma in situ. Survival analysis of progression, mortality and recurrence revealed a statistically significant difference among the 3 risk groups. The rates of recurrence, progression and mortality were 37\%, 0\% and 0\% in the low, 45\%, 1.8\% and 0.73\% in the intermediate, and 54\%, 15\% and 9.5\% in the high risk group, respectively. The relative risks of recurrence, progression and mortality in the low versus the intermediate and high risk groups were 1.37, 2.84 and 1, and 1.87, 24.76 and 14.69, respectively. Risk group classification based on prognostic factors defines progression, mortality and recurrence rates in primary superficial bladder cancer.

Our objective was to estimate the life expectancy of the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study cohort and quantify improvements by comparing two subcohorts based on year of diabetes diagnosis (1950-1964 [n = 390] vs. 1965-1980 [n = 543]). The EDC study is a prospective cohort study of 933 participants with childhood-onset (aged {$<$}17 years) type 1 diabetes diagnosed at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1950 to 1980. Mortality ascertainment was censored 31 December 2009. Abridged cohort life tables were constructed to calculate life expectancy. Death occurred in 237 (60.8\%) of the 1950-1964 subcohort compared with 88 (16.2\%) of the 1965-1980 subcohort. The life expectancy at birth for those diagnosed 1965-1980 was \textasciitilde 15 years greater than participants diagnosed 1950-1964 (68.8 [95\% CI 64.7-72.8] vs. 53.4 [50.8-56.0] years, respectively) (P {$<$} 0.0001); this difference persisted regardless of sex or pubertal status at diagnosis. This improvement in life expectancy emphasizes the need for insurance companies to update analysis of the life expectancy of those with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes because weighting of insurance premiums is based on outdated estimates.},

Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register for randomized trials in December 2004 and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 25 2006) and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 30th 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized trials. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo. Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50, 100 and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified four eligible randomized trials. MAIN RESULTS: The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole treated patients and 503 placebo treated patients. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (P value = 0.042, hazard ratio 0.80, 95\% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.99) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P value = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P value {$<$} 0.0001) and the random effects model, which takes this into account, resulted in the overall treatment effect estimate falling just short of significance (P value = 0.056, hazard ratio 0.84, 95\% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.01). This represented a 9\% gain in the probability of surviving one year (57\% in the placebo and 66\% in the riluzole group). There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (weighted mean difference 2.62, 95\% confidence interval 1.59 to 4.31). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

  abstract = {PurposeSurvival following ovarian cancer diagnosis is generally low; understanding factors related to prognosis could be important to optimize treatment. The role of previously diagnosed comorbidities and use of medications for those conditions in relation to prognosis for ovarian cancer patients has not been studied extensively, particularly according to histological subtype.MethodsUsing pooled data from fifteen studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium, we examined the associations between history of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and medications taken for these conditions and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among patients diagnosed with invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and stage to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) overall and within strata of histological subtypes.ResultsHistory of diabetes was associated with increased risk of mortality (n = 7,674; HR = 1.12; 95\% CI = 1.01–1.25). No significant mortality associations were observed for hypertension (n = 6,482; HR = 0.95; 95\% CI = 0.88–1.02) or heart disease (n = 4,252; HR = 1.05; 95\% CI = 0.87–1.27). No association of these comorbidities was found with PFS in the overall study population. However, among patients with endometrioid tumors, hypertension was associated with lower risk of progression (n = 339, HR = 0.54; 95\% CI = 0.35–0.84). Comorbidity was not associated with OS or PFS for any of the other histological subtypes. Ever use of beta blockers, oral antidiabetic medications, and insulin was associated with increased mortality, HR = 1.20; 95\% CI = 1.03–1.40, HR = 1.28; 95\% CI = 1.05–1.55, and HR = 1.63; 95\% CI = 1.20–2.20, respectively. Ever use of diuretics was inversely associated with mortality, HR = 0.71; 95\% CI = 0.53–0.94.ConclusionsHistories of hypertension, diabetes, and use of diuretics, beta blockers, insulin, and oral antidiabetic medications may influence the survival of ovarian cancer patients. Understanding mechanisms for these observations could provide insight regarding treatment.},

  abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important cause of liver disease burden across the world. By definition, although the histopathologic features of NAFLD are identical to that of alcoholic liver disease, its diagnosis requires absence of significant alcohol use and absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. We now know that NAFLD is not simply a disease of the Western world. It is manifested across the world, in varying rates, across gender, across varying ethnicities, and in its association with other host factors. In this review article, the definition of NAFLD, its spectrum, ranging from mild steatosis to hepatocellular injury and inflammation defined as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is discussed. Mild steatosis is generally a stable disease whereas NASH can be progressive. Based on current published literature, current incidence and prevalence of NAFLD and NASH are discussed. It is also accepted that these processes will continue to increase in prevalence with the rise of obesity, type II diabetes, and associated metabolic syndrome. Some of the risk factors have been well-established and are discussed. In addition, this review also presents emerging associations with other risk factors for NAFLD. Natural history of NAFLD is variable depending upon the histologic subtypes and other underlying comorbidities and is discussed in this review as well.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives: Abstracting information about comorbid illnesses from the medical record can be time-consuming, particularly when a large number of conditions are under consideration. We sought to determine which conditions are most prognostic and whether comorbidity continues to contribute to a survival model once laboratory and clinical parameters have been accounted for. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: Comorbidity data were abstracted from the medical records of Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Pattern Study (DOPPS) I, II, and III participants using a standardized questionnaire. Models that were composed of different combinations of comorbid conditions and case-mix factors were compared for explained variance (R2) and discrimination (c statistic). Results: Seventeen comorbid conditions account for 96\% of the total explained variance that would result if 45 comorbidities that were expected to be predictive of survival were added to a demographics-adjusted survival model. These conditions together had more discriminatory power (c statistic 0.67) than age alone (0.63) or serum albumin (0.60) and were equivalent to a combination of routine laboratory and clinical parameters (0.67). The strength of association of the individual comorbidities lessened when laboratory/clinical parameters were added, but all remained significant. The total R2 of a model adjusted for demographics and laboratory/clinical parameters increased from 0.13 to 0.17 upon addition of comorbidity. Conclusions: A relatively small list of comorbid conditions provides equivalent discrimination and explained variance for survival as a more extensive characterization of comorbidity. Comorbidity adds to the survival model a modest amount of independent prognostic information that cannot be substituted by clinical/laboratory parameters.},

In MID, advanced disability indicated a relative risk of dying over twice as high. In both diseases the risk of death was substantially higher in the event of occurrence of primitive reflexes.},

The patients were originally found in a community-based epidemiological survey of dementia, and all patients with AD or MID alive on the prevalence day were included. The 6-years survival rate for AD was 21.1\% vs. the expected rate 48.5\%, that for MID 11.9\% vs. 45.2\% expected. A comparison of relative survival rates suggested that MID carries a less favorable survival prognosis than AD. The mean durations were: AD 5.7 years and MID 5.2 years; median duration being 5 years in both diseases. The excess mortality in both AD and MID was independent of age. In AD, the survival rate decreased with increasing severity of dementia, while in MID the mortality was the same regardless of the severity of the dementia. The dementia disorder was the underlying cause of death in 68\% of AD patients, and in 38\% of MID patients, bronchopneumonia being the most frequent immediate cause of death in both groups. As a cause of death, acute cerebrovascular accidents occurred more often in MID patients than in the general population of comparable age. Malignant diseases were less frequent as a cause of death in both dementia groups than in the general population.},

The aim of the study was to assess the long-term survival, incidence of cardiac complications, factors that predict outcome, and effect of mitral surgery on the long-term prognosis of patients with asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation amenable to valve repair. Methods One hundred ninety-two asymptomatic patients (mean age, 63 ± 13 years) with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation diagnosed by 2-dimensional echocardiography between 1990 and 2001 were prospectively followed for a median of 8.5 years. Results Overall, cardiovascular, and event-free survival was evaluated in 2 groups of patients: a “conservative approach” group (n = 67) and an “early surgery” group (n = 125). Outcomes were also analyzed among patients with atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, or both, as well as in patients free of any mitral regurgitation complications. In the whole population, 10-year overall survival was significantly lower with the conservative approach than early surgery (50\% ± 7\% vs 86\% ± 4\%, log-rank {$<$} 0.0001). Similar results were obtained in the subgroups with atrial fibrillation and/or pulmonary hypertension. The 10-year propensity-matched score-adjusted hazards ratio for overall mortality, cardiac mortality, and cardiovascular events for the conservative treatment were 5.21, 4.83, and 4.40, respectively. Conclusion Our results show that the outcome of asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation is better with an early surgical approach rather than a more conservative treatment strategy.},

  abstract = {A landmark review of studies published prior to 1989 on socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity supported the view that obesity in the developing world would be essentially a disease of the socioeconomic elite. The present review, on studies conducted in adult populations from developing countries, published between 1989 and 2003, shows a different scenario for the relationship between SES and obesity. Although more studies are necessary to clarify the exact nature of this relationship, particularly among men, three main conclusions emerge from the studies reviewed: 1. Obesity in the developing world can no longer be considered solely a disease of groups with higher SES. 2. The burden of obesity in each developing country tends to shift towards the groups with lower SES as the country's gross national product (GNP) increases. 3. The shift of obesity towards women with low SES apparently occurs at an earlier stage of economic development than it does for men. The crossover to higher rates of obesity among women of low SES is found at a GNP per capita of about US\$ 2500, the mid-point value for lower-middle-income economies. The results of this review reinforce the urgent need to: include obesity prevention as a relevant topic on the public health agenda in developing countries; improve the access of all social classes in these countries to reliable information on the determinants and consequences of obesity; and design and implement consistent public actions on the physical, economic, and sociocultural environment that make healthier choices concerning diet and physical activity feasible for all. A significant step in this direction was taken with the approval of the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health by the World Health Assembly in May 2004.},

This study compared the performance of 7 established comorbidity scores in predicting mortality after kidney transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 2033 incident renal transplant recipients. Comorbidity was assessed at baseline, and the following scores were derived: Recipient Risk Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, Modified End-Stage Renal Disease Charlson Comorbidity Index, Foley Score, Wright-Khan Index, and Davies Index. Cox models investigated the association of each comorbidity score with mortality; performance characteristics were tested using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Age-stratified Cox analyses showed the Recipient Risk Score-based model displayed the best fit, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the Recipient Risk Score demonstrated greatest predictive use (5-year mortality c-statistic: 0.787). The independent effect of age on mortality was demonstrated after analysis of scores not containing age as a component (the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Modified End-Stage Renal Disease Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Davies Index); addition of age to these scores improved fit. CONCLUSIONS: Of the currently available comorbidity scores, the Recipient Risk Score demonstrated greatest use. This has implications for deceased-donor allocation algorithms, assessment of confounders in clinical research, and potentially, individual patient management.},

Following the introduction of levodopa in the late 1960's, many studies reported improved or normalized mortality rates in PD. Despite the remarkable symptomatic benefits provided by levodopa, multiple recent studies have demonstrated that PD patients continue to die at a rate in excess of their peers. We undertook this retrospective study of 211 deceased PD patients to determine the factors associated with mortality in levodopa-treated PD. Our findings confirm that PD is associated with increased mortality in both men and women. Unlike the majority of other mortality studies, we found that women have a greater reduction in lifespan compared to men. We also found that patients with early onset PD (onset at the age of 50 or before) have reduced survival relative to PD patients with later ages of onset. A final important finding is that survival is equal in PD patients treated with levodopa early (within 2 years or less of PD onset) versus later.},

The study was conducted in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, U.K., and included all diabetic deaths between 1993 and 1996. RESULTS: Of 1,694 deaths in patients with known diabetes, only 674 (39.8\%) had diabetes recorded as an immediate or antecedent cause of death. Mortality rates were 41.8 per 1,000 for the diabetic population and 10.1 per 1,000 for the nondiabetic population. The standard mean ratio for the diabetic population was 1.24 (95\% CI 1.12-1.35), with the risk of mortality relative to the nondiabetic population decreasing with age. Males with diabetes lost an average of 7.0 years from the year of diagnosis, and females with diabetes lost an average of 7.5 years. The most common cause of death was cardiovascular disease, which accounted for 49.1\% of deaths in the diabetic population. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is recorded as a cause of death on a minority of death certificates for patients with diabetes. Using death certificates in isolation, therefore, is a poor method of estimating diabetic mortality, but results can be improved with the use of record linkage techniques. Patients with diabetes have an excess risk of mortality compared with the nondiabetic population. Life-years lost for patients with diabetes is strongly related to age at diagnosis and is a means of expressing mortality without relying on accurate prevalence data.},

There is increasing evidence to suggest that such a limited approach is inadequate. OBJECTIVE: To carry out a prospective study of those factors influencing the rate of decline of the ventilatory capacity in a cohort of automobile workers. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Southern Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 181 workers employed in assembling and spray painting the chassis of new cars, a minority of whom used paints containing isocyanates. MEASUREMENTS: All participants underwent annual anthropometric measurements. Spirometry was carried out at yearly intervals, and a questionnaire relating to respiratory symptoms and smoking habits was completed annually by all participants. Daily monitoring of the isocyanate levels was carried out. RESULTS: There was no indication of any effect from isocyanate exposure. The annual decline in the FEV(1) was similar to that found in other studies, with the respective annual decrements for smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers being 0.055 L, 0.046 L, and 0.035 L, respectively. The decline of the FEV(1) in those {$>$} 35 years old and {$<$} 35 years old differed appreciably. The decrements in the FEV(1) in subjects {$<$} 35 years old were influenced as much by excessive weight gain as by cigarette smoking. Loss of weight in those significantly overweight was frequently associated with improved lung function. CONCLUSIONS: While age and smoking play an important role in determining the rate of decline in the ventilatory capacity, it is clear that body weight plays a significant role and needs to be taken into account in all epidemiologic studies of the ventilatory capacity},

  abstract = {Summary Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological tumour in developed countries, and its incidence is increasing. The most frequently occurring histological subtype is endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Patients are often diagnosed when the disease is still confined to the uterus. Standard treatment consists of primary hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, often using minimally invasive approaches (laparoscopic or robotic). Lymph node surgical strategy is contingent on histological factors (subtype, tumour grade, involvement of lymphovascular space), disease stage (including myometrial invasion), patients' characteristics (age and comorbidities), and national and international guidelines. Adjuvant treatment is tailored according to histology and stage. Various classifications are used to assess the risks of recurrence and to determine optimum postoperative management. 5 year overall survival ranges from 74\% to 91\% in patients without metastatic disease. Trials are ongoing in patients at high risk of recurrence (including chemotherapy, chemoradiation therapy, and molecular targeted therapies) to assess the modalities that best balance optimisation of survival with the lowest adverse effects on quality of life.},

Patients and Methods A tissue microarray was constructed of 483 patients with endometrial cancer of diverse histologic type and stage and tested for HER-2 expression and amplification using current standards of practice. There was outcome data for 83\% of all patients and 81\% with complete surgical staging.   Results Both expression and amplification of HER-2 was associated with high-grade (P = .0001) and high stage (P = .0001) endometrial cancer. The highest rate of HER-2 expression and amplification was seen in serous carcinoma (43\% and 29\%), while grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma showed the lowest levels (3\% and 1\%). For all histologic types, the rate of HER-2 expression and amplification was remarkably different (P {$<$} .0001) for grade 3 cancers (31\% and 15\%) versus grade 2 (7\% and 3\%) and grade 1 cancers (3\% and 1\%), with similar results for endometrioid type (P {$<$} .0001). Both HER-2 expression and amplification correlated with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. By multivariate analysis HER-2 expression in the presence of amplification (P = .012) correlated with overall survival, but not expression in the absence of amplification. Overall survival was significantly shorter (P = .0001) in patients who overexpressed (median, 5.2 years) and/or showed amplification of HER-2 (median, 3.5 years) versus those that did not (median of all cases, 13 years).   Conclusion Our results would suggest that HER-2 is an important oncogene in high grade and stage endometrial cancer, but plays only a minor role in the much more common low grade and stage tumors that encompass the majority of clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Some risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence in the general population are not associated with CHD incidence among patients with ESRD but have not been well characterized in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The association of several risk factors with CHD incidence was studied among participants with CKD in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. CHD risk factors and estimated GFR using serum creatinine were measured among 807 ARIC participants with CKD (estimated GFR between 15 and 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2). The incidence of CHD during 10.5 yr of follow-up was 6.3, 8.5, and 14.4 per 1000 person-years among ARIC participants with an estimated GFR of ≥90, 60 to 89, and 15 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. After adjustment for age, race, gender, and ARIC field center, among those with CKD, the relative risk (95\% confidence interval) of CHD was 1.65 (1.01 to 2.67) for current smoking, 2.02 (1.27 to 3.22) for hypertension, 3.06 (2.01 to 4.67) for diabetes, and 1.96 (1.14 to 3.36) for anemia. The comparably adjusted relative risks of CHD for each standard deviation higher total and HDL cholesterol were 1.50 (1.25 to 1.71) and 0.79 (0.62 to 1.01), respectively, and 1.38 (1.13 to 1.69), 1.24 (1.06 to 1.46), 0.65 (0.54 to 0.79), and 1.38 (1.19 to 1.59) for waist circumference, leukocyte count, serum albumin, and fibrinogen, respectively. CHD risk factors in the general population remain predictive among patients with CKD. Given the high risk for CHD among patients with CKD, control of these risk factors may have a substantial impact on their excess burden of CHD.},

  abstract = {Hypertension is a leading cause of death because of cardiovascular disease and predominantly affects total mortality. To reduce avoidable deaths from hypertension, we need to collect blood pressure data and assess their impact on total mortality. To examine this issue, a meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies was conducted in Japan. Poisson regression was used for estimating all-cause mortality rates and ratios. In the model, blood pressure data were treated as continuous (10-mm Hg increase) and categorical (every 10 mm Hg) according to recommendations of the Seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension. Potential confounders included body mass index, smoking, drinking, and cohort. The impact of hypertension was measured by the population-attributable fraction. After excluding participants with cardiovascular disease history, 176 389 participants were examined in the analysis. Adjusted mortality rates became larger as the blood pressure increased, and these were more distinct in younger men and women. Hazard ratios also showed the same trends, and these trends were more apparent in younger men (hazard ratio [unit: 10-mm Hg increase] aged 40 to 49 years: systolic blood pressure 1.37 (range: 1.15 to 1.62); diastolic blood pressure 1.46 [range: 1.05 to 2.03]) than older ones (hazard ratio: aged 80 to 89 years: systolic blood pressure 1.09 [range: 1.05 to 1.13]and diastolic blood pressure 1.12 [range: 1.03 to 1.22]). Population-attributable fraction of hypertension was ≈20\% when the normal category was used as a reference level and was 10\% when we included the prehypertension group in the reference level. In conclusion, high blood pressure raised the risk of total mortality, and this trend was higher in the younger Japanese population.},

Methods We conducted post-hoc analysis of data from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC Study), a large prospective cohort study. 11,594 white and African American (24.2\%) men and women, aged 45–64 years, with available Framingham Risk Score (FRS) variables and ABIs at baseline, and without known history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus or known peripheral arterial disease at baseline were assessed for hard cardiovascular events (hCVD; defined as heart attack, coronary death or stroke) over median follow-up of 10 years. Hazard ratios, C statistic, and net reclassification indexes were calculated to determine the independent predictive ability of ABI compared with FRS. Results 659 hCVD events occurred. Standardized ABI was significantly associated with hCVD events but with a relatively small effect on events (hazard ratios of 0.85 per standard deviation (95\% CI 0.79–0.91) (p-value{$<$}0.0001)). The C statistic of FRS modified with ABI was only modestly improved (0.756–0.758). Net reclassification improvement, an indicator of prospective prediction performance, using an ABI threshold of 0.9 was small and statistically insignificant (0.8\%, p=0.50). Conclusions Although the ABI adjusted for Framingham risk variables was independently associated with subsequent events in terms of hazard ratios, the independent effect of ABI when adjusted for FRS was small in magnitude, and the FRS performed similarly with or without integration or supplementation with ABI. These findings do not provide strong evidence to support FRS modification to include ABI.},

  abstract = {Comparative mortality of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in Canada. Comparisons of mortality rates in patients on hemodialysis versus those on peritoneal dialysis have been inconsistent. We hypothesized that comorbidity has an important effect on differential survival in these two groups of patients. Eight hundred twenty-two consecutive patients at 11 Canadian institutions with irreversible renal failure had an extensive assessment of comorbid illness collected prospectively, immediately prior to starting dialysis therapy. The cohort was assembled between March 1993 and November 1994; vital status was ascertained as of January 1, 1998. The mean follow-up was 24 months. Thirty-four percent of patients at baseline, 50\% at three months, and 51\% at six months used peritoneal dialysis. Values for a previously validated comorbidity score were higher for patients on hemodialysis at baseline (4.0 vs. 3.1, P {$<$}0.001), three months (3.7 vs. 3.2, P = 0.001), and six months (3.6 vs. 3.2, P = 0.005). The overall mortality was 41\%. The unadjusted peritoneal dialysis/hemodialysis mortality hazard ratios were 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.51 to 0.83, P = 0.0005), 0.84 (95\% CI, 0.66 to 1.06, P = NS), and 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.64 to 1.08, P = NS) based on the modality of dialysis in use at baseline, three months, and six months, respectively. When adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, malignancy, and acuity of renal failure, the corresponding hazard ratios were 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.62 to 1.01, P = NS), 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.78 to 1.28, P = NS), and 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.73 to 1.24, P = NS). Adjustment for a previously validated comorbidity score resulted in hazard ratios of 0.74 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.94, P = 0.01), 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.19, P = NS), and 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.68 to 1.13, P = NS) at baseline, three months, and six months. There was no survival advantage for either modality in any of the major subgroups defined by age, sex, or diabetic status. The apparent survival advantage of peritoneal dialysis in Canada is due to lower comorbidity and a lower burden of acute onset end-stage renal disease at the inception of dialysis therapy. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, as practiced in Canada in the 1990s, are associated with similar overall survival rates.},

We evaluated risk of breast cancer death among statin users in a population-based cohort of breast cancer patients. The study cohort included all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in Finland during 1995–2003 (31,236 cases), identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Information on statin use before and after the diagnosis was obtained from a national prescription database. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate mortality among statin users with statin use as time-dependent variable. A total of 4,151 participants had used statins. During the median follow-up of 3.25 years after the diagnosis (range 0.08–9.0 years) 6,011 participants died, of which 3,619 (60.2\%) was due to breast cancer. After adjustment for age, tumor characteristics, and treatment selection, both post-diagnostic and pre-diagnostic statin use were associated with lowered risk of breast cancer death (HR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.38–0.55 and HR 0.54, 95\% CI 0.44–0.67, respectively). The risk decrease by post-diagnostic statin use was likely affected by healthy adherer bias; that is, the greater likelihood of dying cancer patients to discontinue statin use as the association was not clearly dose-dependent and observed already at low-dose/short-term use. The dose- and time-dependence of the survival benefit among pre-diagnostic statin users suggests a possible causal effect that should be evaluated further in a clinical trial testing statins’ effect on survival in breast cancer patients.},

The natural history of NAFLD and the optimal strategy to identify subjects with progressive liver disease are unclear.Objectives. To assess the evidence in: (1) natural history of NAFLD; and (2) non-invasive methods to differentiate NAFLD histological subtypes.Design and setting. Among 4185 articles published on MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Pubmed, national and International meeting abstracts through July 2010, 40 articles assessing the natural history of NAFLD and 32 articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests against liver biopsy (LB) were included.Measurements. Two reviewers retrieved articles and evaluated study quality by appropriate scores. Main outcomes were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models.Results. NAFLD has an increased overall mortality (OR: 1.57, 95\% CI: 1.18–2.10), deriving from liver-related and cardiovascular disease, and a 2-fold risk of diabetes. Compared to SS, NASH has a higher liver-related (OR for NASH: 5.71, 2.31–14.13; OR for NASH with advanced fibrosis: 10.06, 4.35–23.25), but not cardiovascular mortality (OR: 0.91, 0.42–1.98). Three non-invasive methods received independent validation: pooled AUROC, sensitivity and specificity of cytokeratin-18 for NASH are 0.82 (0.78–0.88), 0.78 (0.64–0.92), 0.87 (0.77–0.98). For NASH with advanced fibrosis, pooled AUROC, sensitivity and specificity of NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibroscan are 0.85 (0.80–0.93), 0.90 (0.82–0.99), 0.97 (0.94–0.99) and 0.94 (0.90–0.99), 0.94 (0.88–0.99) and 0.95 (0.89–0.99).Conclusions. NAFLD warrants screening for cardio-metabolic risk and for progressive liver disease.

Anxiety comorbid with depression lowered mortality compared with depression alone (anxiety depression interaction P = 0.017). The association between anxiety symptom load and mortality was U-shaped. Conclusions Depression as a risk factor for mortality was comparable in strength to smoking. Comorbid anxiety reduced mortality compared with depression alone.

However, the majority of clinical trials do not reflect the demographics of CLL patients treated in the community. We examined treatment patterns, outcomes, and disease-related mortality in patients\,≥\,75~years with CLL (E-CLL) in a real-world setting. Methods The Connect® CLL registry is a multicenter, prospective observational cohort study, which enrolled 1494 adult patients between 2010–2014, at 199 US sites. Patients with CLL were enrolled within 2~months of initiating first line of therapy (LOT1) or a subsequent LOT (LOT\,≥\,2). Kaplan–Meier methods were used to evaluate overall survival. CLL- and infection-related mortality were assessed using cumulative incidence functions (CIF) and cause-specific hazards. Logistic regression was used to develop a classification model. Results A total of 455 E-CLL patients were enrolled; 259 were enrolled in LOT1 and 196 in LOT\,≥\,2. E-CLL patients were more likely to receive rituximab monotherapy (19.3 vs. 8.6\%; p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and chemotherapy-alone regimens (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) than younger patients. Overall and complete responses were lower in E-CLL patients than younger patients when given similar regimens. With a median follow-up of 3~years, CLL-related deaths were higher in E-CLL patients than younger patients in LOT1 (12.6 vs. 5.1\% p\,=\,0.0005) and LOT\,≥\,2 (31.3 vs. 21.5\%; p\,=\,0.0277). Infection-related deaths were also higher in E-CLL patients than younger patients in LOT1 (7.4 vs. 2.7\%; p\,=\,0.0033) and in LOT\,≥\,2 (16.2 vs. 11.2\%; p\,=\,0.0786). A prognostic score for E-CLL patients was developed: time from diagnosis to treatment\,{$<$}\,3~months, enrollment therapy other than bendamustine/rituximab, and anemia, identified patients at higher risk of inferior survival. Furthermore, higher-risk patients experienced an increased risk of CLL- or infection-related death (30.6 vs 10.3\%; p\,=\,0.0006). Conclusion CLL- and infection-related mortality are higher in CLL patients aged\,≥\,75~years than younger patients, underscoring the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies for these understudied patients.

DESIGN A retrospective study of sick-leave and disability pension in health examined obese subjects was performed. The indirect cost of obesity in Sweden was estimated from reported and recorded sick-leave and disability pension in the sample and from the estimated prevalence of obesity in the country. SUBJECTS 1298 obese persons aged 30-59 y. The mean age was 46 years. The mean body mass Index was 39 kg/m2 (range 28-68). SETTING The obese subjects were recruited from eight counties in Sweden. RESULTS As compared to the general Swedish population the obese subjects had 1.5-1.9 times higher sick-leave during one year. Twelve percent of the obese women had disability pension while the corresponding figure in the general population was 5\%. The incremental cost of sick-leave and disability pensions attributable to obesity was 3.6 billion SEK during one year, which is equivalent to about 300 million USD per million female adult population. The total cost for sick-leave and disability pension due to absence from work for the obese fraction of the Swedish female population was 10.5 billion SEK during one year. CONCLUSION Obesity represents a major health problem with significant economic implications for the society. Approximately 10 percent of the total cost of loss of productivity due to sick-leave and disability pensions in women may be related to obesity and obesity-related diseases.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to compare the survival of sarcoid patients with pulmonary fibrosis with that of the general population and to determine the causes of death and the incidence of evolutive complications. This retrospective cohort included 142 sarcoid patients in radiographic stage IV (74 males; mean±sd age 48.1±12 yrs). Their survival was compared with that of the general French population, matched for the year and age at diagnosis of stage IV disease, sex and length of follow-up. Expected survival probabilities were calculated year-by-year on the basis of probabilities provided by official demographic data for France. Survival curves were based on the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. During the follow-up period (7.1±4.8 yrs), pulmonary hypertension (PH) was observed in 29.7\% of cases and aspergilloma in 11.3\%. Long-term oxygen therapy was required in 12\%. Survival was 84.1\% at 10 yrs, which was worse than for the general population (p=0.013). 16 (11.3\%) patients died from the following causes: refractory PH (n=5), chronic respiratory insufficiency (n=4), acute respiratory insufficiency (n=2), haemoptysis due to aspergilloma (n=1), heart sarcoidosis (n=1), nocardiosis (n=1) and unknown causes (n=2). Survival is significantly decreased in stage IV patients. 75\% of fatalities are directly attributable to respiratory causes.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present paper was to evaluate the influence of a family history of hypertension and the degree of obesity as indicated by tertiles of body mass index on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) values in large number (n = 406) of young mild essential hypertensives. Positive family history of hypertension was associated with a significant increase in 24h ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP). The difference was most pronounced in the upper tertile of body mass index with almost 6 mm Hg difference between patients with and without a family history of hypertension. Both the degree of obesity and family history of hypertension had significant effects on 24h diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Twenty four hour DBP was highest in the upper tertile of body mass index in the hypertensives with a positive family history, representing an increase of 5 mm Hg compared with patients with a negative family history in the lower tertile. We conclude that mild hypertensives with a positive family history of hypertension are characterised by higher ambulatory BP than patients without parental hypertension and similar supine BP. Furthermore, our results indicate that in mild hypertensives the increase in DBP with body mass index is underestimated by conventional sphygmomanometry},

Survival rates up to 5\hspace{0.25em}years were calculated by Cox's proportional hazard model for 1605 patients. Results During the follow‐up period, 241 deaths were recorded. The crude 5‐year survival rate for the entire cohort was 86\% (95\% CI 84 to 88), and annual mortality ranged from 2.2\% to 3.0\%. A higher cardiothoracic ratio on chest x ray (HR 1.61; 95\% CI 1.26 to 2.05, with 1 SD (6.2\%) increase), a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 1.42; 95\% CI 1.20 to 1.69, with 1 SD (13\%) decrease) and the presence of left bundle branch block (HR 3.14; 95\% CI 1.28 to 7.71) were independently associated with a poorer prognosis, whereas the presence of apical hypertrophy at baseline (HR 0.58; 95\%CI 0.36 to 0.92) predicted a better chance of survival. Conclusions The nationwide survey of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy yielded important information on its prognosis and prognostic factors. These observations afford, for the first time, a measure of risk stratification in patients with HCM in Japan.},

We aimed to confirm this paradox and assess whether it extends to long-term outcome. In addition, we investigated temporal mortality trends.Methods:We examined the relation between the presence of four modifiable risk factors for CHD (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking) and mortality in 14,434 consecutive patients admitted with MI to a coronary care unit from 1985 to 2008.Results:Two-thirds of MI patients (n?=?10,003) had at least one risk factor for CHD on hospital admission. The presence of at least one compared to no CHD risk factors was associated with a favourable 30-day mortality rate (5\% vs. 7\%, adjusted odds ratio 0.72, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.62?0.83). There was significant interaction between the presence of CHD risk factors and decade of hospitalization (p?=?0.001). The adjusted 10-year mortality hazard ratio (HR) of at least one CHD risk factor compared to none, was 1.2 (95\% CI: 1.0--1.4), 0.89 (0.65--1.2) and 0.89 (0.79--0.99) in 1985--1990, 1990--2000 and 2000--2008, respectively. Survival improved over time. Adjusted 10-year mortality fell (adjusted HR [2000--2008 vs. 1985--1990] 0.59 [95\% CI: 0.52--0.66] in patients with, and 0.76 [95\% CI: 0.65?0.89] in those without CHD risk factors).Conclusions:The presence of at least one modifiable CHD risk factor was associated with improved outcome after MI. Patients with CHD risk factors benefited from more substantial mortality reductions during the past few decades.},

The purpose of the current study is to 1) assess the association between modifiable risk factors and all-cause mortality among a nationally representative sample of individuals with diabetes and 2) determine the population-attributable risk percent (PAR\%) for these factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 1,507 adults over the age of 17 years with a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) mortality study. Our main outcome measures were all-cause mortality and PAR\%. We used the Cox proportional hazard analysis to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for known diabetes risks and calculated PAR\%. RESULTS - Among adults with diabetes, the HRs for all-cause mortality were significant for individuals who had an A1C ≥8\% (HR 1.65, 95\% CI 1.11-2.45) or reported no regular physical activity (1.58, 1.24 -2.02) or current tobacco use (1.77, 1.15-2.73). The population-attributable risk was 15.3\% for A1C value ≥8\%, 16.4\% for no regular physical activity, and 7.5\% for current tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS - Health systems may consider prioritizing care to include smoking cessation, increasing physical activity, and moderate glycemic control among patients with diabetes. This study suggests that focusing on these areas may result in significant reductions in mortality in individuals with diabetes. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.},

  abstract = {AIM: To review economic evaluations of weight loss drugs and compare reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). METHODS: A literature search was conducted for cost-effectiveness (CEAs) and cost-utility analyses (CUAs) of sibutramine, orlistat and rimonabant. RESULTS: Fourteen unique articles were identified (11 CUAs and 3 CEAs; 9 orlistat, 4 sibutramine and 1 rimonabant). All used diet and exercise as comparator, whereas none included indirect costs. Time horizons varied from treatment period only (1-4 years) to 80 years (median 7.5 years). Longer studies modeled effects on diabetes, micro- and macrovascular complications, coronary heart disease and death. Of the CUAs, the median ICER was 16,000 euro(2007)/QALY (quality-adjusted life-year; range 10,000-88,000), with the worst cost-effectiveness when recommended stop rules for non-responding patients were not applied. All studies but three were funded by the manufacturing company, and the median ICER was considerably higher for independent than for sponsored analyses (62,000 euro vs 15,000 euro/QALY). However, two of the three independent CUAs did not use recommended stop rules, as compared with one of eight manufacturer-sponsored analyses. The results were most sensitive to assumptions regarding weight loss sustainability and utility per kilogram lost. Side effects and dropout because of reasons other than lack of efficacy were generally not incorporated. CONCLUSION: Published economic evaluations indicate that orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant are within the range of what is generally regarded as cost-effective. Uncertainty remains about weight loss sustainability, utility gain associated with weight loss and extrapolations from transient weight loss to long-term health benefits. Modeling of head-to-head comparisons and attrition is needed, as are analyses conducted independently of manufacturing companies},

In Sweden, the three greatest drivers of such productivity losses are musculo-skeletal, circulatory and psychiatric disorders, all closely associated with weight status. We identified 16 studies investigating the body mass index (BMI)-disability pension relation. In cross-sectional studies, a significantly greater proportion of obese compared with normal weight subjects were disability pensioners. In longitudinal studies, a J-shaped relation with BMI was generally found in both men and women of various ages. Different definitions of obesity status complicated interpretation, as several studies mixed the underweight and normal weight, which appear to have different disability pension risks. In middle-aged men, relative risks were elevated for circulatory causes only for the overweight and obese, while associations for mental disorders were similar in the underweight and overweight but much higher in the obese. In both sexes, monotonic increases and decreases were seen for circulatory and respiratory causes respectively. In intervention studies, reduced disability pension incidence and increased gainful employment were reported after surgery. In summary, BMI was significantly associated with disability pension, but the direction of causality may vary with underlying cause. Interventions had positive productivity effects in the morbidly obese, but whether this holds for the overweight remains to be proven.},

Pooling of effect estimates was not possible due to great heterogeneity between studies regarding definition of sick leave (short-term/long-term), measure of obesity (body mass index/waist circumference/percentage body fat), definition of obesity status (World Health Organization standards/other), study population (sex/age/occupation/country) and exposure and outcome ascertainment (self-reported/objectively assessed). Nevertheless, a clear trend towards greater sick leave among obese compared with normal weight workers could be discerned, especially for spells of longer duration. In studies from the USA, which consistently reported about five times lower number of sick leave days per person-year than European, obese workers had about 1-3 extra days of absence per person-year compared with their normal weight counterparts. In European studies, the corresponding difference was about 10 d. For overweight workers the data were conflicting, indicating either increased or neutral level of sick leave compared with normal weight. Regarding underweight, the studies were very few and concerns regarding direction of causality were greater. Finally, in all four interventional studies identified substantial weight loss in obese subjects resulted in reduced sick leave, at least temporarily. In conclusion, increasing obesity in children and adults is likely to negatively affect future productivity as obesity increases the risk of sick leave, disability pension and death.},

METHODS:~A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 985 endometrial cancer cases treated from January 1999 through December 2009 at a single institution. Disease-specific survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to study factors associated with survival. All statistical tests were two-sided and performed using Stata.         RESULTS:~At the time of analysis, 230 patients (22\% of evaluable patients) died of disease and median follow-up was 3.28 years. Disease-specific survival was greater (179/220 [81\%]) for women with endometrial cancer taking statin therapy at the time of diagnosis and staging compared with women not using statins (423/570 [74\%]) (log rank test, P=.03). This association persisted for the subgroup of patients with nonendometrioid endometrial tumors who were statin users (59/87 [68\%]) compared with nonusers (93/193 [43\%]) (log rank test, P=.02). The relationship remained significant (hazard ratio 0.63, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.99) after adjusting for age, clinical stage, radiation, and other factors. Further evaluation of polypharmacy showed an association between concurrent statin and aspirin use with an especially low disease-specific mortality (hazard ratio 0.25, 95\% CI 0.09–0.70) relative to those who used neither.         CONCLUSION:~Statin and aspirin use was associated with improved survival from nonendometrioid endometrial cancer.},

It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regard to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and/or angina. It originated in 1902, when no measurements of cardiac function were possible, to provide a common language for physicians to communicate. Despite difficulties in applying it, such as the challenge of consistently classifying patients in class II or III, because functional capacity is such a powerful determinant of outcome it remains arguably the most important prognostic marker in routine clinical use in heart failure today. Another frequently used functional classification of cardiovascular disease is the Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading of angina pectoris.},

  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Objectives:}} It was the aim of this study to determine the prognostic significance of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) following acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and assess the prognosis of patients without comorbidities (defined as a CCI score of 0). \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} Outcomes of 1,023 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed PE were tracked after a median of 3.7 years (25-75th interquartile range 1.5-6.1 years). All were assigned a non-age-adjusted CCI score. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} The median CCI score was 1.0 (interquartile range 0.0-3.0). Three hundred and fifty-one (34\%) patients had a CCI score of 0. Only 1 (0.3\%) of 31 in-hospital deaths occurred in patients with a CCI score of 0. Long-term mortality for these patients was similar to the population-derived age- and sex-matched mortality rate, and was significantly better than for those with a CCI score ≥1 (12.5 vs. 47.5\%; p {$<$} 0.0001 adjusted for age and sex). In multivariate analysis, CCI (per 1-score increase) independently predicted in-hospital (hazard ratio 1.27, 95\% confidence interval 1.09-1.49; p = 0.003) and post-discharge (hazard ratio 1.35, 95\% confidence interval 1.29-1.42; p {$<$} 0.0001) death. The c statistics for the multivariate prediction models for in-hospital (incorporating CCI score and serum sodium level) and post-discharge death (age, CCI score, hyperlipidemia, serum sodium and hemoglobin) were 0.738 and 0.788, respectively (both p {$<$} 0.0001). \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} The CCI can be incorporated into risk models, with good discriminatory power, for predicting in-hospital and long-term outcomes following acute PE. Patients with a CCI score of 0 have a favorable long-term outcome following acute PE.},

  abstract = {The prognosis of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is still ill-defined. The present study prospectively evaluated mortality and complications in a large cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The study included 838 anti-HCV and HCV-RNA–positive patients who were followed for 50.2 ± 26.9 months (mean ± SD; range, 6-122 months) in a prospective protocol. During follow-up, 62 patients died (31 from liver disease and 31 from other causes), and 12 patients needed liver transplantation. When compared with a matched general population, hepatitis C increased mortality mainly when cirrhosis was present and in patients who were less than 50 years old at study entry. During follow-up, a further 30 patients developed nonlethal complications of cirrhosis. By multivariate regression, survival was decreased by cirrhosis, long disease duration, history of intravenous drug abuse, and excessive alcohol consumption, whereas interferon therapy improved survival. Alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirubin, sex, and genotype had no effect on survival. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 17) was increased by cirrhosis and to a lesser degree by long disease duration and high bilirubin, whereas interferon therapy, genotype, and other factors had no effect. Chronic hepatitis C is a disease with considerable mortality and morbidity when cirrhosis is present at diagnosis. Patients who acquire the infection early in life have a markedly increased mortality even when cirrhosis is absent at diagnosis. The age at diagnosis therefore should play a major role in therapeutic considerations. The present data also suggest that interferon therapy has a long-term clinical benefit, although it did not reduce the risk of liver cancer.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims We investigated mortality of patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), compared with the Danish population and sought to determine whether clinical presentations of CP can be used in prognosis. We also investigated clinical factors associated with mortality and causes of death among these patients. Methods The Copenhagen Pancreatitis Study is a prospective study of patients admitted from 1977 to 1982 to the 5 main hospitals in Copenhagen with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or CP. In 2008, follow-up data were collected from these patients from the Danish Registries; this subcohort comprised 290 patients with probable (n = 41) or definite CP (n = 249). Results The mortality of patients with definite CP was 4-fold that of the Danish population and significantly higher than that of patients with probable CP (P = .003; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.21–2.57); patients with probable CP had a 2- to 3-fold higher mortality rate than the population. In patients with definite CP, factors significantly associated with mortality included non-employment (P = .015; 95\% CI, 0.53–0.93), and being underweight (P = .020; 95\% CI, 0.52–0.95). Sex, alcohol use, smoking, single versus co-living, exocrine insufficiency, diabetes, pancreatic calcification, CP inheritance, painless CP, acute exacerbation of CP, or surgery for CP had no impact on survival. The most frequent causes of death were digestive diseases (19.5\%), malignancies (19.5\%), and cardiovascular diseases (11.3\%). Conclusions Danish patients with definite CP had a 4-fold higher mortality rate compared with the background population and a higher mortality rate than patients with probable CP. Being nonemployed or underweight had significant impact on survival.},

  abstract = {Acute and chronic pancreatitis are most frequently caused by a high consumption of alcohol and tobacco but often the aetiology is unknown. The diseases have a high risk of complications, but the long-term prognosis and the natural course of the diseases are only sparsely described. The aims of the study were to investigate the long-term prognosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP), the risk of progression to CP, and the natural course of progressive acute pancreatitis. Hereby, describe the prognostic factors associated with mortality and the causes of death in these patients. The study was based on the large prospective cohort study - Copenhagen Pancreatitis Study - of patients in the Copenhagen Municipality admitted with either AP or CP fulfilling specific diagnostic criteria and enrolled in the study during 1977 to 1982 and in 2008 followed up by linkage to the Danish registries. Factors associated with mortality in AP patients were high age, alcohol and diabetes, whereas female gender, employment, and co-living were associated with better survival. Level of S-amylase had no impact on the mortality. AP can progress to CP not only from alcoholic but also from idiopathic AP within a mean interval of 3.5 years. The mortality of progressive AP was 5-7 times higher compared with the background population. Patients with definite CP had a 4-fold higher mortality than the background population and patients with a suspicion of CP had twice the mortality compared with the background population. Unlike alcohol and smoking, both non-employment and being underweight had a significant impact on survival in CP patients. In the future, when diagnosing AP, we suggest focusing more on the elimination of differential diagnosis than on the level of S-amylase. The high mortality in progressive AP indicates that patients with risk factors for CP should be followed up. As both AP and CP are multifaceted, treatment for smoking dependency, alcohol dependency, and social and nutritional support is encouraged. More knowledge could be provided by interventional treatment of these four focus areas in patients with AP and CP.},

The aims were to describe: (1) the incidence of progression from AP to CP, (2) prognostic factors for progression, and (3) the natural course and mortality of progressive AP. METHODS: During 1977 to 1982, patients admitted to hospitals in Copenhagen with a diagnosis of AP or CP were included in a prospective cohort and followed up by the Danish registries in 2008. The subcohort analyses comprised 352 AP patients. RESULTS: Progressive AP was found in 85 patients (24.1\%) during follow-up; 48.2\% developed from alcoholic AP, 47.0\% from idiopathic AP, and 4.8\% from other causes. The mortality rate for patients with progressive AP was 2.7 times higher than in patients with nonprogressive acute pancreatitis, and 5.3 to 6.5 times higher than in the background population. In Cox regression analyses corrected for age, only smoking was of significance for the progression from AP to CP. CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis can progress to CP, not only from alcoholic but also from nonalcoholic AP. Smoking was the strongest risk factor associated with progression. The mortality rate for these patients was 5 to 6 times the mortality rate in the population.},

We examined relative survival in patients treated by long-term dialysis in the Italian Dialysis and Transplantation Registry in order to determine the prognosis of dialysis patients. Study Design Cohort study drawn from a registry. Setting \& Participants Patients enrolled in the Italian Dialysis and Transplantation Registry. Factors Sex, age, primary kidney disease, renal replacement therapy modality, and main comorbid conditions. Outcomes Death from any cause. Measurements Relative survival ratio (the ratio of observed survival in the population of interest to the survival expected given the age- and period-specific mortality of the general population) and excess mortality rate (difference between observed and expected mortality rates). Results In January 2000 to December 2008, a total of 27,642 patients were included. The 5-year relative survival estimate was 55.6\% (95\% CI, 54.7\%-56.5\%). The excess mortality rate showed a peak at 3 months (21 deaths/100 patient-years), then decreased, becoming constant from the end of year 1 to year 8, with leveling off at about 10 deaths/100 patient-years. Older age, systemic diseases, and diabetes showed the strongest association with excess mortality. Peritoneal dialysis was associated with a lower relative excess risk in only the first year of treatment. Limitations The patient cohort comprises about half the Italian patients beginning dialysis therapy in the period. Conclusions This study highlights the applicability of relative survival methods in dialysis patients. This measure allows estimation of disease prognosis and severity comparisons among chronic diseases. The excess mortality rate appears to be a more sensitive and informative measure than the simple proportion of survivors.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Adenocarcinoma of the lung is now the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer in the United States. To determine if there are survival differences in never-smokers and current smokers with adenocarcinoma, we conducted an analysis of lung adenocarcinomas seen at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, and looked for demographic and survival differences in the two groups. DESIGN: Data were gathered through the tumor registry at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and confirmed by chart review. A total of 132 documented never-smokers and 522 current smokers with lung adenocarcinoma were included. Detailed demographic survival information were gathered and tabulated. Former smokers were not included in the study. Multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox regression method to identify variables with independent prognostic significance. Life table actuarial analyses were performed to determine survival. Differences between survival curves were estimated using the log-rank test. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis for never-smokers was higher as compared to current smokers: 63.5 years vs 59.4 years (p = 0.0005). In addition, there was an increased percentage of female subjects in the never-smoker category: 78\% vs 54\% (p {$<$} 0.0001). There was a statistically significant difference in survival between current smokers and never-smokers (p = 0.004). The Kaplan-Meier estimates at 5 years were 16\% for current smokers and 23\% for never-smokers. On multivariate analyses, smoking was identified as an independent negative prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: Our data show that never-smokers with adenocarcinoma are predominantly female, present at a higher mean age, and have improved survival when compared to current smokers. By multivariate analyses, the never-smoking status was found to be an independent predictor of improved survival. The survival difference may be partly influenced by less comorbidity among never-smokers. Nevertheless, owing to differences in the mechanism of carcinogenesis (in smokers vs nonsmokers), demographic factors, tumor behavior and survival, adenocarcinomas occurring in never-smokers may display a distinct natural history and may warrant further investigation as a separate entity with epidemiologic studies and clinical trials designed specifically for this category of non-small cell lung cancer.},

Data sources Medline and Embase. Eligibility criteria Cohort studies examining the association between atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and death. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics and the relative risk of outcomes associated with atrial fibrillation: specifically, all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, any stroke, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic heart disease, sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Estimates were pooled with inverse variance weighted random effects meta-analysis. Results 104 eligible cohort studies involving 9 686 513 participants (587 867 with atrial fibrillation) were identified. Atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.46, 95\% confidence interval 1.39 to 1.54), cardiovascular mortality (2.03, 1.79 to 2.30), major cardiovascular events (1.96, 1.53 to 2.51), stroke (2.42, 2.17 to 2.71), ischaemic stroke (2.33, 1.84 to 2.94), ischaemic heart disease (1.61, 1.38 to 1.87), sudden cardiac death (1.88, 1.36 to 2.60), heart failure (4.99, 3.04 to 8.22), chronic kidney disease (1.64, 1.41 to 1.91), and peripheral arterial disease (1.31, 1.19 to 1.45) but not haemorrhagic stroke (2.00, 0.67 to 5.96). Among the outcomes examined, the highest absolute risk increase was for heart failure. Associations between atrial fibrillation and included outcomes were broadly consistent across subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of death and an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal disease. Interventions aimed at reducing outcomes beyond stroke are warranted in patients with atrial fibrillation.},

Questionnaires concerning beliefs about the causes, consequences and solutions to obesity were completed by 89 general practitioners (GPs) and 599 patients from practices across UK. In terms of causes, the results showed that the patients were more likely to attribute obesity to a gland/hormone problem, slow metabolism and stress than the GPs, whereas the GPs were more likely to blame eating too much. In terms of consequences, the patients rated difficulty getting to work more highly whereas the GPs regarded diabetes as more important. For the solutions to obesity, the two groups reported similar beliefs for a range of methods, but whereas the patients rated the GP and a counsellor as more helpful, the GPs rated the obese person themselves more highly. It is argued that patients show a self serving model of obesity by blaming internal uncontrollable factors for causing obesity yet expecting external factors to solve it. In contrast, GPs show a victim blaming model by attributing both cause and the solution to internal controllable factors. Such differing models have implications regarding the form of intervention likely to be used in primary care and indicate that whereas patients would prefer a more professional based approach, GPs would prefer a more patient-led one. Further, the results suggest that even if an intervention could be negotiated, success rates would be low as either the patient or the GP would be acting in contradiction to their beliefs about the nature of obesity},

  abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common among the elderly. However, little is known about how the clinical implications of CKD vary with age. We examined the age-specific incidence of death, treated end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among 209,622 US veterans with CKD stages 3 to 5 followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Patients aged 75 years or older at baseline comprised 47\% of the overall cohort and accounted for 28\% of the 9227 cases of ESRD that occurred during follow-up. Among patients of all ages, rates of both death and ESRD were inversely related to eGFR at baseline. However, among those with comparable levels of eGFR, older patients had higher rates of death and lower rates of ESRD than younger patients. Consequently, the level of eGFR below which the risk of ESRD exceeded the risk of death varied by age, ranging from 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for 18 to 44 year old patients to 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for 65 to 84 year old patients. Among those 85 years or older, the risk of death always exceeded the risk of ESRD in this cohort. Among patients with eGFR levels {$<$}45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline, older patients were less likely than their younger counterparts to experience an annual decline in eGFR of {$>$}3 ml/min per 1.73 m2. In conclusion, age is a major effect modifier among patients with an eGFR of {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, challenging us to move beyond a uniform stage-based approach to managing CKD.},

  abstract = {Current National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative staging criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are intended to apply to all age groups. However, it is unclear whether different levels of estimated GFR (eGFR) have the same prognostic significance in older and younger patients. The study cohort was composed of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients who were aged 18 to 100 yr and had at least one outpatient serum creatinine measurement between October 1, 2001, and September 30, 2002 (n = 2583,911). Patients with ESRD were excluded. GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation using each patient’s first outpatient creatinine measurement during the study period. The association of eGFR with survival was measured by age group. Twenty percent of cohort patients had an eGFR {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, ranging from 3\% among 18- to 44-yr-olds to as high as 49\% among 85- to 100-yr-olds. Fifty-two percent (n = 266,421) of cohort patients with an eGFR {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 had “very” moderate reductions in eGFR into the 50- to 59-ml/min per 1.73 m2 range. The association of eGFR with mortality was weaker in the elderly than in younger age groups: Whereas severe reductions in eGFR were associated with an increased risk for death in all age groups, “very” moderate reductions in eGFR (50 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2) were associated with an increased adjusted risk for death only among patients who were younger than 65 yr. Age-related attenuation of the association of eGFR with mortality was also present among women and black patients. In the clinical setting, mortality risk stratification in elderly patients should not be based on the same eGFR cut points as for younger age groups and would benefit from finer categorization of the 30- to 59-ml/min per 1.73 m2 eGFR group.},

Methods From January 2004 to December 2014, 200 non-metastatic urothelial bladder cancer patients who underwent radical cystectomy were divided into two groups according to diabetes mellitus status at the time of surgery. Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis were used to assess the association between diabetes mellitus and urothelial bladder cancer recurrence-free, cancer-specific and overall mortality. Results Of the 200 patients, 28 (14\%) had diabetes mellitus and presented similar preoperative factors and pathological findings after radical cystectomy, including pathological stage, grade, lymph node invasion and positive surgical margin compared with non-diabetes mellitus patients (n~=~172). The 5-year cancer-specific survivals were 92.3\% and 62.1\% in the non-diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus groups, respectively (P~=~0.022). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that diabetes mellitus was a significant predictor for cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio 1.785, P~=~0.038). The 5-year overall survival rate was 92.1\% and 59.4\% in the non-diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus groups, respectively (P~=~0.014), and diabetes mellitus was a significant factor for overall mortality by multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 1.281, P~=~0.042). Conclusions Among bladder cancer patients who underwent radical cystectomy, the diabetes mellitus patients had worse cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality outcomes than the non-diabetes mellitus patients. The mechanism of association between diabetes mellitus and urothelial bladder cancer should be investigated to validate the present results in a future prospective study.},

DESIGN Data sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. To be included, studies must have assessed the performance of BMI to measure body adiposity, provided standard values of diagnostic performance, and used a body composition technique as the reference standard for body fat percent (BF\%) measurement. We obtained pooled summary statistics for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). The inconsistency statistic (I2) assessed potential heterogeneity. RESULTS The search strategy yielded 3341 potentially relevant abstracts, and 25 articles met our predefined inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated 32 different samples totaling 31 968 patients. Commonly used BMI cutoffs to diagnose obesity showed a pooled sensitivity to detect high adiposity of 0.50 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.57) and a pooled specificity of 0.90 (CI: 0.86-0.94). Positive LR was 5.88 (CI: 4.24-8.15), I (2)=97.8\%; the negative LR was 0.43 (CI: 0.37-0.50), I (2)=98.5\%; and the DOR was 17.91 (CI: 12.56-25.53), I (2)=91.7\%. Analysis of studies that used BMI cutoffs {$>$}or=30 had a pooled sensitivity of 0.42 (CI: 0.31-0.43) and a pooled specificity of 0.97 (CI: 0.96-0.97). Cutoff values and regional origin of the studies can only partially explain the heterogeneity seen in pooled DOR estimates. CONCLUSION Commonly used BMI cutoff values to diagnose obesity have high specificity, but low sensitivity to identify adiposity, as they fail to identify half of the people with excess BF\%.},

The objective of the present study was to reappraise epidemiology and long-term outcomes in subjects with thoracic aortic disease in a large contemporary population. METHODS AND RESULTS: All subjects with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection identified in Swedish national healthcare registers from 1987 to 2002 were included in the present study. Of 14,229 individuals with thoracic aortic disease, 11,039 (78\%) were diagnosed before death. Incidence of thoracic aortic disease rose by 52\% in men and by 28\% in women to reach 16.3 per 100,000 per year and 9.1 per 100,000 per year, respectively. Operations increased 7-fold in men and 15-fold in women over time. Of the 2455 patients who underwent operation, 389 (16\%) died within 30 days, with older age and thoracic aortic rupture as risk factors. In Cox analysis, increasing age was the only variable associated with long-term mortality. Both short- and long-term mortality improved over time. In patients who underwent operation, actuarial survival (95\% CI) at 1, 5, and 10 years was 92\% (91\% to 93\%), 77\% (75\% to 80\%), and 57\% (53\% to 61\%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of thoracic aortic reoperations was 7.8\% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and incidence of thoracic aortic disease was higher than previously reported and increasing. The annual number of operations increased substantially. Surgical (30-day) and long-term survival improved significantly over time to form a growing cohort of patients needing counseling, management decisions, operations, and extended postoperative surveillance.},

Results Among 1134 patients, 21\% underwent radiation and 24\% chemotherapy as initial treatment. In the balanced cohort of 347 patients with stage IE, radiotherapy alone was associated with a better cause-specific survival [hazard ratio (HR) 0.27, P {$<$} 0.001]. Patients receiving systemic therapy had better survival if it incorporated rituximab (HR 0.53, P = 0.017). After adjustment for confounding, the outcomes of those who received rituximab alone or combination chemoimmunotherapy were not statistically different (P = 0.14). Conclusions In elderly patients with stage IE gastric MALT lymphoma, radiotherapy was associated with lower risk of lymphoma-related death than chemotherapy. In those requiring systemic treatment, addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy to rituximab in the first-line regimen was not associated with improved survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Prognostic factors and outcomes in patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) have been studied in small cohort studies, which may not reflect the population at large. METHODS. Clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of adult patients with MZL who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 were evaluated using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The authors generated clinical prognostic models for subtypes of MZL and compared survival during the periods of 1995 through 2000, 2001 through 2004, and 2005 through 2009. RESULTS. The prognosis was significantly better for patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (5-year relative survival rate of 88.7\%; P {$<$} .0001) compared with those with the splenic MZL (SMLZ)or nodal MZL (NMZL) subtypes (5-year relative survival rates of 79.7\% and 76.5\%, respectively). There was evidence of improved outcomes in patients with NMZL and MALT lymphomas between 1995 and 2009 (P {$<$} .0001), with no difference noted in patients with SMZL (P = .56). Advancing age and the presence of B symptoms had prognostic significance in all MZL subtypes. Male sex and stage of disease were significant only for the NMZL and MALT categories. Survival in patients with MALT lymphomas varied depending on the site of origin, with a worse prognosis noted in those with gastrointestinal and pulmonary locations of origin (5-year incidence rate of lymphoma-related death, 9.5\%-14.3\%) compared with ocular, cutaneous, and endocrine sites (4.5\%-7.8\%; P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSIONS. The survival for patients with SMZL is similar to that for those with NMZL, and unlike the NMZL and MALT subtypes, it has not improved over the past decade. The prognosis of patients with MALT lymphoma varies according to the anatomical site of origin. Cancer 2013. © 2012 American Cancer Society.},

Summary Background Data The Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL) is a prospective multicenter NIH study comparing outcomes of LDLT and DDLT and associated risks. Methods Mortality and graft failure for 1427 liver recipients (963 LDLT) enrolled in A2ALL transplanted between 1/1/1998 and 1/31/2014 at 12 North American centers with median follow-up 6.7 years were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox models. Results Survival probability at 10 years was 70\% for LDLT and 64\% for DDLT. Unadjusted survival was higher with LDLT (HR=0.76, p=0.02) but attenuated after adjustment (HR=0.98, p=0.90) as LDLT recipients had lower mean MELD (15.5 vs 20.4) and fewer were transplanted from ICU, inpatient, on dialysis, ventilated, or with ascites. Post-transplant ICU days were less for LDLT. For all recipients female gender and primary sclerosing cholangitis were associated with improved survival, while dialysis and older recipient/donor age were associated with worse survival. Higher MELD score was associated with increased graft failure. Era of transplantation and type of donated lobe did not impact survival in LDLT. Conclusions LDLT provides significant long-term transplant benefit resulting in transplantation at a lower MELD score, decreased death on waitlist, and excellent post-transplant outcomes. Recipient diagnosis, disease severity, renal failure, and ages of recipient and donor should be considered in decision-making regarding timing of transplant and donor options.

  abstract = {Background \& Aims It is unknown whether mortality differs between patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and those who cleared the virus after infection. We examined the impact of chronic HCV replication on mortality among Danish patients testing positive for HCV antibodies. Methods This nationwide cohort study focused on Danish patients with at least one HCV RNA measurement available after testing positive for HCV antibodies between 1996 and 2005. To capture long-term prognosis, eligible patients needed to be alive 1year after HCV RNA assessment. We estimated mortality rate ratios (MRRs) using Cox regression (for overall mortality) and subdistribution hazard ratios (SDHRs) for cause-specific mortality, controlling for gender, age, comorbidity, calendar period, alcohol abuse, injection drug use, and income. Results Of the 6292 patients under study, 63\% had chronic HCV-infection and 37\% had cleared the virus. Five-year survival was 86\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 84–87\%) in the chronic HCV group and 92\% (95\% CI: 91–94\%) in the cleared HCV group. Chronic HCV-infection was associated with higher overall mortality (MRR: 1.55, 95\% CI: 1.28–1.86) and liver-related death (SDHR: 2.42, 95\% CI: 1.51–3.88). Chronic HCV-infection greatly increased the risk of death from primary liver cancer (SDHR: 16.47, 95\% CI: 2.24–121.00). Conclusions Patients with chronic HCV-infection are at higher risk of death than patients who cleared the infection. The substantial association found between chronic HCV-infection and death from primary liver cancer supports early initiation of antiviral treatment in chronically HCV-infected patients.},

  abstract = {Background Smoking is the most important individual risk factor for many cancer sites but its association with breast and prostate cancer is not entirely clear. Rate advancement periods (RAPs) may enhance communication of smoking related risk to the general population. Thus, we estimated RAPs for the association of smoking exposure (smoking status, time since smoking cessation, smoking intensity, and duration) with total and site-specific (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, gastric, head and neck, and pancreatic) cancer incidence and mortality. Methods This is a meta-analysis of 19 population-based prospective cohort studies with individual participant data for 897,021 European and American adults. For each cohort we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for the association of smoking exposure with cancer outcomes using Cox regression adjusted for a common set of the most important potential confounding variables. RAPs (in years) were calculated as the ratio of the logarithms of the HRs for a given smoking exposure variable and age. Meta-analyses were employed to summarize cohort-specific HRs and RAPs. Results Overall, 140,205 subjects had a first incident cancer, and 53,164 died from cancer, during an average follow-up of 12~years. Current smoking advanced the overall risk of developing and dying from cancer by eight and ten years, respectively, compared with never smokers. The greatest advancements in cancer risk and mortality were seen for lung cancer and the least for breast cancer. Smoking cessation was statistically significantly associated with delays in the risk of cancer development and mortality compared with continued smoking. Conclusions This investigation shows that smoking, even among older adults, considerably advances, and cessation delays, the risk of developing and dying from cancer. These findings may be helpful in more effectively communicating the harmful effects of smoking and the beneficial effect of smoking cessation.

  abstract = {In epidemiologic studies and in studies of discordant twins, cigarette smoking has been consistently associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease, but whether this association is causal remains controversial. Alternatively, an infectious or toxic exposure in childhood or early adulthood could affect both the reward mechanisms that determine smoking behavior and the future risk of Parkinson's disease. If so, parental smoking, commonly established before the birth of the first child, would be unlikely to be related to Parkinson's disease risk. The authors assessed the association between Parkinson's disease and parental smoking during childhood in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study conducted in the United States. During 26 years and 18 years of follow-up, respectively, 455 newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease cases were documented among those who provided information on parental smoking. The age-adjusted, pooled relative rate of Parkinson's disease was 0.73 (95\% confidence interval: 0.53, 1.00; P-trend\,=\,0.04) comparing participants who reported that both parents smoked with those who reported that neither did. Adjustment for caffeine and alcohol intake did not materially change the results. If the inverse association between smoking and Parkinson's disease were due to confounding by an environmental factor or were the result of reverse causation, it is unlikely that parental smoking would predict Parkinson's disease.},

Since 2003, a substantial number of clinical and experimental data concerning the adverse renal effects of smoking have been published, including large, prospective, population-based, observational studies. These more recent data together with evidence from experimental studies clearly indicate that smoking is a relevant risk factor, conferring a substantial increase in risk for renal function deterioration. This review summarizes the present knowledge about the renal risks of smoking as well as the increased cardiovascular risk caused by smoking in patients with chronic kidney disease. The conclusion is that smoking is an important renal risk factor, and nephrologists have to invest more efforts to motivate patients to stop smoking.},

Measurements Treated SUDs of alcohol and illicit substances identified in treatment registers; suicide attempt identified in treatment registers; and completed suicides identified in the Cause of Death register. Covariates were sex and age at diagnosis. Findings Having any SUD was associated with at least a threefold increased risk of completed suicide when compared with those having no SUD. Alcohol misuse was associated with an increased risk of completed suicide in all populations with hazard ratios (HR) between 1.99 [95\% confidence interval (CI)~=~1.44–2.74] and 2.70 (95\% CI~=~2.40–3.04). Other illicit substances were associated with a two- to threefold risk increase of completed suicide in all populations except bipolar disorder, and cannabis was associated with increased risk of attempted suicide only in people with bipolar disorder (HR~=~1.86, 95\% CI~=~1.15–2.99). Alcohol and other illicit substances each displayed strong associations with attempted suicide, HR ranging from 3.11 (95\% CI~=~2.95–3.27) to 3.38 (95\% CI~=~3.24–3.53) and 2.13 (95\% CI~=~2.03–2.24) to 2.27 (95\% CI~=~2.12–2.43), respectively.

We compared the incidence and prevalence of diabetes, and its impact on mortality, among status Aboriginal adults and adults in the general population between 1995 and 2007. METHODS: We examined de-identified data from Alberta Health and Wellness administrative databases for status Aboriginal people (First Nations and Inuit people with treaty status) and members of the general public aged 20 years and older who received a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus from Apr. 1, 1995, to Mar. 31, 2007. We calculated the incidence and prevalence of diabetes and mortality rate ratios by sex and ethnicity in 2007. We examined the average relative changes per year for longitudinal trends. RESULTS: The average relative change per year in the prevalence of diabetes showed a smaller increase over time in the Aboriginal population than in the general population (2.39 v. 4.09, p {$<$} 0.001). A similar finding was observed for the incidence of diabetes. In the Aboriginal population, we found that the increase in the average relative change per year was greater among men than among women (3.13 v. 1.88 for prevalence, p {$<$} 0.001; 2.60 v. 0.02 for incidence, p = 0.001). Mortality among people with diabetes decreased over time to a similar extent in both populations. Among people without diabetes, mortality decreased in the general population but was unchanged in the Aboriginal population (-1.92 v. 0.11, p = 0.04). Overall, mortality was higher in the Aboriginal population than in the general population regardless of diabetes status. INTERPRETATION: The increases in the incidence and prevalence of diabetes over the study period appeared to be slower in the status Aboriginal population than in the general population in Alberta, although the overall rates were higher in the Aboriginal population. Mortality decreased among people with diabetes in both populations but was higher overall in the Aboriginal population regardless of diabetes status.},

  abstract = {Background and Aim Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A liver biopsy is considered the “gold standard” for diagnosing/staging NASH. Identification of NAFLD/NASH using non-invasive tools is important for intervention. The study aims were to: develop/validate the predictive performance of a non-invasive model (index of NASH [ION]); assess the performance of a recognized non-invasive model (fatty liver index [FLI]) compared with ION for NAFLD diagnosis; determine which non-invasive model (FLI, ION, or NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS]) performed best in predicting age-adjusted mortality. Methods From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III database, anthropometric, clinical, ultrasound, laboratory, and mortality data were obtained (n = 4458; n = 861 [19.3\%] NAFLD by ultrasound) and used to develop the ION model, and then to compare the ION and FLI models for NAFLD diagnosis. For validation and diagnosis of NASH, liver biopsy data were used (n = 152). Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard modeling estimated the association among the three non-invasive tests (FLI, ION, and NFS) and mortality. Results FLI's threshold score {$>$} 60 and ION's threshold score {$>$} 22 had similar specificity (FLI = 80\% vs ION = 82\%) for NAFLD diagnosis; FLI {$<$} 30 (80\% sensitivity) and ION {$<$} 11 (81\% sensitivity) excluded NAFLD. An ION score {$>$} 50 predicted histological NASH (92\% specificity); the FLI model did not predict NASH or mortality. The ION model was best in predicting cardiovascular/diabetes-related mortality; NFS predicted overall or diabetes-related mortality. Conclusions The ION model was superior in predicting NASH and mortality compared with the FLI model. Studies are needed to validate ION.},

  abstract = {Chronic pancreatitis is a chronic clinical disorder characterized by irreversible damage to the pancreas and the development of histologic evidence of inflammation and fibrosis, and eventually the destruction and permanent loss of exocrine and endocrine tissue. A nationwide survey in Japan revealed an increase in the total number of patients treated for chronic pancreatitis from 32 000 in 1994 to 42 000 in 1999. The overall prevalence and the incidence rate of chronic pancreatitis also increased, from 28.5 and 5.4, respectively, in 1994 to 32.91 and 5.77 per 100 000 population, respectively, in 1999. Diagnostic criteria for chronic pancreatitis in Japan were proposed by the Japan Pancreas Society in 1995 and revised in 2001. The criteria were established to rule out false-positive cases and to confidently diagnose definite and probable cases of chronic pancreatitis, and thus easily detect advanced chronic pancreatitis, but the criteria are unable to lead to the early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Cancer is the major cause of death in patients with chronic pancreatitis in Japan (49.6\% of all deaths in patients with chronic pancreatitis). Clarification of the mechanisms by which possible chronic pancreatitis progresses to probable or definite chronic pancreatitis, and to pancreatic cancer, is an important research goal. Because even chronic pancreatitis defined as irreversible appears to be reversible for some time in its clinical course, there is an urgent need to develop methods for diagnosing reversible chronic pancreatitis, and to prevent the transition from chronic pancreatitis to pancreatic cancer.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether cholesterol level are an independent predictor of survival in ALS. Methods Cholesterol levels were measured in 427 ALS subjects from three clinical trial databases. Results The LDL/HDL ratio did not decrease over time, despite significant declines in body mass index (BMI), forced vital capacity (FVC), and ALSFRS-R. After adjusting for BMI, FVC, and age, the lipid ratio was not associated with survival. There was a “U”-shaped association between BMI and mortality, with the highest survival at 30–35 kg/m2. The adjusted hazard ratio for the linear association between BMI and survival was 0.860 (95\% CI 0.80–0.93, P = 0.0001). Conclusions We found that dyslipidemia is not an independent predictor of survival in ALS. BMI is an independent prognostic factor for survival after adjusting for markers of disease severity.},

Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in all subjects with randomized, independent, double reading of CT scans focusing on benign asbestos-related abnormalities. Cox model survival regression analysis was used to model lung cancer mortality according to the presence of pleural plaques, with age as the main time variable, adjusting for smoking and asbestos cumulative exposure index. All statistical tests were two-sided.Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-six deaths from lung cancer were recorded. Lung cancer mortality was significantly associated with pleural plaques in the follow-up study in terms of both the unadjusted hazard ratio of 2.91 (95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.49–5.70) and the adjusted hazard ratio of 2.41 (95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.21–4.85) after adjustment for smoking and asbestos cumulative exposure index.Conclusions: Pleural plaques may be an independent risk factor for lung cancer death in asbestos-exposed workers and could be used as an additional criterion in the definition of high-risk populations eligible for CT screening.},

  abstract = {Background Statins have uncertain benefits in chronic kidney disease (CKD) as individual trials may have insufficient power to determine whether treatment effects differ with severity of CKD. Purpose To summarize the benefits and harms of statin therapy for adults with CKD and examine whether effects of statins vary by kidney disease stage. Data Sources Cochrane and EMBASE databases (inception to February 2012). Study Selection Randomized trials comparing effects of statins with placebo, no treatment or another statin on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Data Extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data Synthesis Eighty trials (n=51,099) compared statin with placebo or no treatment. Treatment effects varied with stage of CKD. In persons not on dialysis, statins reduced all-cause (relative risk, 0·81, 95\% confidence interval, 0·74-0·88) and cardiovascular (0·78, 0·68-0·89) mortality and cardiovascular events (0·76, 0·73-0·80) in moderate-high quality evidence. For persons on dialysis, statins had little or no effect on all-cause (0·96, 0·88-1·04) or cardiovascular (0.94, 0.82-1.07) mortality or cardiovascular events (0·95, 0·87-1·03) in moderate-high quality evidence. Effects of statins in kidney transplant recipients were uncertain. Statins had little or no effect on cancer, myalgia, liver function, or withdrawal from treatment, although adverse events were evaluated systematically in fewer than half of trials. Limitations Reliance on post hoc subgroup data for earlier stages of CKD and lack of data for primary and secondary prevention. Conclusions Statins lower mortality and cardiovascular events in persons with early stages of CKD, have little or no effect in persons on dialysis, and have uncertain effects in kidney transplant recipients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We have developed an Internet-based, interactive computer model to determine the long-term health outcomes and economic consequences of implementing different treatment policies or interventions in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The model projects outcomes for populations, taking into account baseline cohort characteristics and past history of complications, current and future diabetes management and concomitant medications, screening strategies and changes in physiological parameters over time. The development of complications, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and total costs within populations can be calculated. METHODS: The model is based on a series of sub-models that simulate important complications of diabetes (cardiovascular disease, eye disease, hypoglycaemia, nephropathy, neuropathy, foot ulcer, amputation, stroke, ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis and mortality). Each sub-model is a Markov model using Monte Carlo simulation incorporating time, state, time-in state, and diabetes type-dependent probabilities derived from published sources. Analyses can be performed on cohorts with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Cohorts, defined in terms of age, gender, baseline risk factors and pre-existing complications, can be modified or new cohorts defined by the user. Economic and clinical data in the model can be edited, thus ensuring adaptability by allowing the inclusion of new data as they become available; creation of country- or provider-specific versions of the model; and allowing the investigation of new hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: The CORE Diabetes Model allows the calculation of long-term outcomes, based on the best data currently available. Diabetes management strategies can be compared in different patient populations in a variety of realistic clinical settings, allowing the identification of efficient diabetes management strategies.},

The problem, when analysing the factors related to recurrence, is that the published series may present different methodologic bias: short follow-up, small number of patients, different treatments, factors considered, and other. In addition, different clinical factors related to recurrence have been mentioned: multiplicity, size and location of the tumour, response to intravesical instillations, recurrence rate, and anaplasia. Related to progression, factors such as grade, association with carcinoma in situ (CIS), size of the tumour, and early recurrence have been considered. The author's experience with clinical prognostic factors of recurrence and progression is presented in order to decide on the best therapeutic approach. Experience shows that risk groups for recurrence may differ from those adopted for progression. For patients with low-grade tumors (grade 1 and the majority of grade 2 tumours) multiplicity is the main prognostic factor of recurrence and the main variable to consider when deciding on treatment. Once low-grade tumors become high grade, or in the case of CIS, progression has to be considered, and the tumour should be treated accordingly. In the case of high-grade tumours, although they may recur, progression is the main concern. Clinical prognostic factors may help to decide whether to manage them conservatively (bacillus Calmette-Guérin) or with radical cystectomy.},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to evaluate the relation of active smoking with risk of total mortality and cardiovascular events among diabetic patients. Methods and Results - We searched Medline and Embase databases through May 2015, and multivariate-adjusted relative risks were pooled by using random-effects models. A total of 89 cohort studies were included. The pooled adjusted relative risk (95\% confidence interval) associated with smoking was 1.55 (1.46-1.64) for total mortality (48 studies with 1 132 700 participants and 109 966 deaths), and 1.49 (1.29-1.71) for cardiovascular mortality (13 studies with 37 550 participants and 3163 deaths). The pooled relative risk (95\% confidence interval) was 1.44 (1.34-1.54) for total cardiovascular disease (16 studies), 1.51 (1.41-1.62) for coronary heart disease (21 studies), 1.54 (1.41-1.69) for stroke (15 studies), 2.15 (1.62-2.85) for peripheral arterial disease (3 studies), and 1.43 (1.19-1.72) for heart failure (4 studies). In comparison with never smokers, former smokers were at a moderately elevated risk of total mortality (1.19; 1.11-1.28), cardiovascular mortality (1.15; 1.00-1.32), cardiovascular disease (1.09; 1.05-1.13), and coronary heart disease (1.14; 1.00-1.30), but not for stroke (1.04; 0.87-1.23). Conclusions - Active smoking is associated with significantly increased risks of total mortality and cardiovascular events among diabetic patients, whereas smoking cessation is associated with reduced risks in comparison with current smoking. The findings provide strong evidence for the recommendation of quitting smoking among diabetic patients.},

In this 10-centre, ongoing cohort study, we evaluated the probability of survival and factors affecting survival in Caucasian CHB patients who received long-term entecavir/tenofovir therapy. Methods We included 1,951 adult Caucasians with CHB, with or without compensated cirrhosis and without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at baseline, who received entecavir/tenofovir for ≥12 months (median, six years). Kaplan–Meier estimates of cumulative survival over time were obtained. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated by comparing death rates with those in the Human Mortality Database. Results The one-, five-, and eight-year cumulative probabilities were 99.7, 95.9, and 94.1\% for overall survival, 99.9, 98.3, and 97.4\% for liver-related survival, and 99.9, 97.8, and 95.8\% for transplantation-free liver-related survival, respectively. Overall mortality was independently associated with older age and HCC development, liver-related mortality was associated with HCC development only, and transplantation-free liver-related mortality was independently associated with HCC development and lower platelet levels at baseline. Baseline cirrhosis was not independently associated with any type of mortality. Compared with the general population, in all CHB patients mortality was not significantly different (SMR 0.82), whereas it was lower in patients without HCC regardless of baseline cirrhosis (SMR 0.58) and was higher in patients who developed HCC (SMR 3.09). Conclusion Caucasian patients with CHB and compensated liver disease who receive long-term entecavir/tenofovir therapy have excellent overall and liver-related eight-year survival, which is similar to that of the general population. HCC is the main factor affecting their overall mortality, and is the only factor affecting their liver-related mortality.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—The ASTRAL score was externally validated showing remarkable consistency on 3-month outcome prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The present study aimed to evaluate ASTRAL score’s prognostic accuracy to predict 5-year outcome. Methods—All consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke registered in the Athens Stroke Registry between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010, were included. Patients were excluded if admitted {$>$}24 hours after symptom onset or if any ASTRAL score component was missing. End points were 5-year unfavorable functional outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale 3 to 6, and 5-year mortality. For each outcome, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated; also, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to investigate whether the ASTRAL score was an independent predictor of outcome. The Kaplan–Meier product limit method was used to estimate the probability of 5-year survival for each ASTRAL score quartile. Results—The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the score to predict 5-year unfavorable functional outcome was 0.89, 95\% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.91. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the ASTRAL score was independently associated with 5-year unfavorable functional outcome (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08–1.10). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the ASTRAL score’s discriminatory power to predict 5-year mortality was 0.81 (95\% confidence interval, 0.78–0.83). In multivariate analysis, the ASTRAL score was independently associated with 5-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.09, 95\% confidence interval, 1.08–1.10). During the 5-year follow-up, the probability of survival was significantly lower with increasing ASTRAL score quartiles (log-rank test {$<$}0.001).

METHODS: We identified 3455 breast cancer, 3336 colorectal cancer and 2654 lung cancer patients through the Hospital del Mar cancer registry. The prevalence of comorbidities according to the CCI was calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare survival curves for each cancer location. Cox regression was used to calculate survival hazard ratios and 1-, 3- and 5-year mortality rate ratios adjusted by age, sex, CCI, place of first consultation, stage, treatment and period of diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall unadjusted 5-year follow-up survival proportion was 82.6\% for breast cancer, 55.7\% for colorectal cancer, and 16.3\% for lung cancer. Overall survival was associated with CCI≥3 in breast cancer (HR: 2.33 95\%CI: 1.76-3.08), colorectal cancer (HR: 1.39; 95\%CI: 1.13-1.70) and lung cancer (HR: 1.22; 95\%CI: 1.06-1.40). In breast cancer, the higher the CCI, the higher the adjusted mortality rate ratio and differences were greater in 5-year than in 1-year follow-up survival. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity is a significant predictor of overall survival in cancer patients; however, it has a stronger impact on survival in breast cancer than in colorectal and lung cancer.},

  abstract = {The association of body mass index, smoking, and blood pressure, which are related to the three well-established risk factors of renal cell carcinoma, and survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma is not much studied. Our objective was to evaluate this association. A cohort of 1,036 patients with low stage (pT1 and pT2) renal cell carcinoma who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy were enrolled. We retrospectively reviewed medical records and collected survival data. The body mass index, smoking status, and blood pressure at the time of surgery were recorded. Patients were grouped according to their obesity grade, smoking status, and hypertension stage. Survival analysis showed a significant decrease in overall (P = 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (P {$<$} 0.001) with being underweight, with no differences of smoking status or perioperative blood pressure. On multivariate analysis, perioperative blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mmHg (HR, 2.642; 95\% CI, 1.221-5.720) and being underweight (HR, 4.320; 95\% CI, 1.557-11.984) were independent predictors of overall and cancer-specific mortality, respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that being underweight and perioperative blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mmHg negatively affect cancer-specific and overall survival, respectively, while smoking status does not influence survivals in patients with renal cell carcinoma.},

  abstract = {This supplement provides up-to-date estimates of the numbers (and percentages) of new cancer cases in the UK that are attributable to factors that have been established by international consensus as potentially avoidable causes of the disease. It therefore offers a useful guide to the relative imporance of different preventive interventions. Excluded from consideration are factors that, although known to be effective in reducing the risk of numerically important cancers, do not offer acceptable or practical preventive strategies at present. Early and multiple childbearing (to prevent breast cancer) and the widespread use of anti-androgen drugs (to prevent prostate cancer) come under this category. What remains is a limited number of important factors that can, at least to some extent, be affected by personal or political choices. The most important among these is continuation of the significant reduction in tobacco exposure. Next in importance are reductions in obesity and in heavy alcohol consumption, and certain other dietary changes. Each of these four main strategies for cancer control would also substantially reduce the burden of other on-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular,  diabetic, renal and hepatic disease. Whether, and to what extent, changes in these major causes of cancer can be achieved is another consideration.  Thus, for example, although substantial progress has been made in reducing the number of young people who start smoking, and in helping those who smoke to escape their addiction in time to avoid most of the risk of premature death, tobacco still remains the most  important avoidable cause of cancer, responsible for almost 20\% of all cases of cancer (and, although this supplement does not quantify cancer mortality, for about 25\% of all deaths from cancer, plus similar numbers of deaths from other diseases). Taken together, the causative factors reviewed in this supplement account for an estimated 43\% of all new cases of cancer in the UK (approximately 134 000 new cases in 2010), and about 50\% of all cancer deaths. Most of these cases of cancer (excluding a few thousand due to the natural background of ionising radiation, or due to certain infections that are currently neither preventable nor treatable) could have been prevented by methods that would also prevent many premature deaths from other non-communicable disease. Over the past 40 years in the UK, the probability of death before the age of 70 years has been halved, and over the next few decades it could be halved again by continued improvements in the treatment of disease and by paying appropriate attention to the few major avoidable causes of disease. This supplement will help focus the attention of researchers, individuals and policy makers on the relative importance of the currently known causes of cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of obesity has focused on childhood as a target period. Our aim was to assess whether frequency of adolescent physical activity affected subsequent body mass index (BMI) gain through to mid-adulthood. METHODS: The British birth cohort of all births in 1 week in March 1958, includes information on physical activity frequency and BMI for several ages, 11-45 years. We examined relationships between activity in adolescence and trajectories of BMI between 16 years (or 23 years) and 45 years using multi-level models. Effects of change in activity on BMI and on change in BMI were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: Physical activity at 11 years had no effect on the BMI trajectories, in males or females. More active females at 16 years gained BMI more slowly than others, by 0.007 kg/m2/year per activity category over the period 16-45 years, whereas the most active males gained BMI faster than others, by 0.005 kg/m2/year per activity category. This effect in males was not evident on the BMI trajectory from 23 to 45 years. Consistent with these analyses, change in activity was associated with change in BMI in females, e.g. females active at 16 and 42 years gained less BMI than inactive females (2.1 vs 2.5 kg/m2/10 years). Results for males were inconsistent over the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may lessen the gains in BMI from adolescence onwards, but relationships vary with age, and in later adolescence show opposite effects for males and females. Decreasing activity between adolescence and mid-adulthood in males, and inactivity in both life stages in females may increase BMI gain},

The primary outcome was 5-year survival after HSCT; survival curves, regression models and measurements of explained variation were used to compare scores. Using the EBMT scoring system, survival in the independent dataset was almost identical to those in the original EBMT publication, thus validating the EBMT Risk Score. Adding one extra variable, performance status, or designing a score specifically for early chronic phase by using the original five variables with different breakpoints gave results only slightly better than the original EBMT Score. Sokal and Hasford Scores did not predict survival after HSCT. We concluded that the EBMT Risk Score does not currently require modification.},

Patients and Methods Four thousand sixty-three patients from eight international centers were included in this retrospective study. Histologic subtype (1997 International Union Against Cancer [UICC] criteria of tumor response), age, sex, TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, tumor size, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Goup performance status (ECOG PS), and overall survival were determined in all cases. The prognostic values of clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe histologic features were assessed by uni- and multivariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox model, respectively.   Results Clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe carcinomas accounted for 3,564 (87.7\%), 396 (9.7\%) and 103 (2.5\%) cases, respectively. In univariate analysis, a trend toward a better survival was observed when clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe histologies were considered prognostic categories (log-rank P = .0007). However, in multivariate analysis, TNM stage, Fuhrman grade and ECOG PS, but not histology, were retained as independent prognostic variables (P {$<$} .001).   Conclusion The stratification in three main renal cell carcinoma histologic subtypes as defined by the 1997 UICC–American Joint Committee on Cancer consensus should not be considered a major prognostic variable comparable to TNM stage, Fuhrman grade and ECOG PS.},

Methods The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database (1995–2007) was queried to identify patients with localized T1a kidney cancer undergoing partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy or deferring therapy. We explored independent associations of specific comorbidities with causes of death, and developed a simplified cardiovascular index. Cox proportional hazards, and Fine and Gray competing risks regression were used. Results Of 7177 Medicare beneficiaries in the study population, 754 (10.5\%) deferred therapy, 1849 (25.8\%) underwent partial nephrectomy and 4574 (63.7\%) underwent radical nephrectomy with none of the selected comorbidities identified in 3682 (51.3\%) patients. Congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease were associated with decreased overall survival. The cardiovascular index provided good survival risk stratification, and reclassified 1427 (41\%) patients with a score ≥1 on the Charlson Comorbidity Index to a 0 on the cardiovascular index with minimal concession of 5-year survival. Conclusions Congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease were associated with decreased overall survival among Medicare beneficiaries with small renal masses. The cardiovascular index could serve as a clinically useful prognostic aid when advising older patients that are borderline candidates for surgery or active surveillance.},

We sought to evaluate the differences in mortality for individuals living with HIV and accessing care in these settings. Methods: Data from two national cohort collaborations, the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) Collaboration and UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) Study, were linked. Individuals included in this analysis were aged ≥18 years, had initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) naively between 2000 and 2010 with ≥1 year of follow-up, and were presumed infected via sexual transmission, to improve cohort comparability. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality, accounting for loss to follow-up (LTFU; defined as no contact for {$>$}18 months) as a competing risk. Competing risks Cox regression evaluated the difference in mortality risk between cohorts. Covariates considered in the model included era of ART initiation (2000-2003; 2004-2007; 2008-2010), age at ART initiation, sexual transmission risk category (heterosexual males; heterosexual females; men who have sex with men (MSM)), diagnosis of AIDS-defining illness prior to ART initiation, baseline CD4 count and viral load, and initial ART regimen. Results : The analytic sample included 18,156 individuals; 3218 CANOC and 14,938 UK CHIC Study participants. CANOC participants were more likely to be older (median 40 years [interquartile range (IQR) 34 to 46 years] versus 36 years [IQR 31 to 43 years]), male (95\% versus 70\%), to have baseline viral load ≥100,000 copies/mL (46\% versus 40\%), and belong to the MSM sexual transmission risk category (85\% versus 54\%) (all P{$<$}0.001). The overall mortality rate was 7.3/1000 person-years (PY) (95\% CI 6.7 to 7.8); with a mortality rate of 9.6/1000 PY (95\% CI 8.1 to 11.2) among CANOC participants, and 6.8/1000 PY (95\% CI 6.2 to 7.4) among UK-CHIC Study participants. No difference in mortality was observed between the cohorts in the adjusted competing risk survival analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 1.03 [95\% CI 0.84 to 1.27]). Conclusions: Despite the variation in national HIV care provision and treatment guidelines, and different socio-demographic and clinical profiles, mortality does not differ significantly between the UK CHIC Study and CANOC.}

Methods A multi-centre cohort of patients undergoing curative resection for GC enrolled in an ongoing tissue bank study from 1999 to 2009 was retrospectively analysed. Prospectively collected demographic, surgical and pathological variables were available for this cohort. The primary endpoints investigated were cancer-specific survival and recurrence-free survival using multivariate Cox proportional hazard modelling. Results Five-year cancer-specific survival was 45.9\%, 5-year relapse-free survival was 44.7\% and 30-day mortality was 2.2\%. Variables showing significance on multivariate analysis for cancer-specific and relapse-free survival were AJCC stage, Lauren classification and age at surgery. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the prognostic variables for a predominantly Caucasian GC population are congruent with published prognostic features.

Results There were 618 cases identified and 283 of these died during the follow up time period. Median age at death was 64.3 years, and median survival time post-diagnosis was 2.6 years. Age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis were predictors of survival time in adjusted models; those diagnosed at age 80 or older had shorter survival than those diagnosed at age 50 or younger. Most (92\%) had ALS noted as a cause of death. Discussion Survival post-diagnosis may be improved compared with previous reports. Age at diagnosis continues to be the strongest predictor of prognosis; recall case reporting bias may play a role in estimates of survival time.},

SETTING The Framingham Heart Study with follow-up from 1948 to 1990. PARTICIPANTS 3457 Framingham Heart Study participants who were 30 to 49 years of age at baseline. MEASUREMENTS Mortality rates specific for age and body mass index group (normal weight, overweight, or obese at baseline) were derived within sex and smoking status strata. Life expectancy and the probability of death before 70 years of age were analyzed by using life tables. RESULTS Large decreases in life expectancy were associated with overweight and obesity. Forty-year-old female nonsmokers lost 3.3 years and 40-year-old male nonsmokers lost 3.1 years of life expectancy because of overweight. Forty-year-old female nonsmokers lost 7.1 years and 40-year-old male nonsmokers lost 5.8 years because of obesity. Obese female smokers lost 7.2 years and obese male smokers lost 6.7 years of life expectancy compared with normal-weight smokers. Obese female smokers lost 13.3 years and obese male smokers lost 13.7 years compared with normal-weight nonsmokers. Body mass index at ages 30 to 49 years predicted mortality after ages 50 to 69 years, even after adjustment for body mass index at age 50 to 69 years. CONCLUSIONS Obesity and overweight in adulthood are associated with large decreases in life expectancy and increases in early mortality. These decreases are similar to those seen with smoking. Obesity in adulthood is a powerful predictor of death at older ages. Because of the increasing prevalence of obesity, more efficient prevention and treatment should become high priorities in public health.},

  abstract = {Background— This study assessed the long-term outcome of a large, asymptomatic population with hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis (AS). Methods and Results— We identified 622 patients with isolated, asymptomatic AS and peak systolic velocity ≥4 m/s by Doppler echocardiography who did not undergo surgery at the initial evaluation and obtained follow-up (5.4±4.0 years) in all. Mean age (±SD) was 72±11 years; there were 384 (62\%) men. The probability of remaining free of cardiac symptoms while unoperated was 82\%, 67\%, and 33\% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Aortic valve area and left ventricular hypertrophy predicted symptom development. During follow-up, 352 (57\%) patients were referred for aortic valve surgery and 265 (43\%) patients died, including cardiac death in 117 (19\%). The 1-, 2-, and 5-year probabilities of remaining free of surgery or cardiac death were 80\%, 63\%, and 25\%, respectively. Multivariate predictors of all-cause mortality were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; P{$<$}0.0001), chronic renal failure (HR, 2.41; P=0.004), inactivity (HR, 2.00; P=0.001), and aortic valve velocity (HR, 1.46; P=0.03). Sudden death without preceding symptoms occurred in 11 (4.1\%) of 270 unoperated patients. Patients with peak velocity ≥4.5 m/s had a higher likelihood of developing symptoms (relative risk, 1.34) or having surgery or cardiac death (relative risk, 1.48). Conclusions— Most patients with asymptomatic, hemodynamically significant AS will develop symptoms within 5 years. Sudden death occurs in ≈1\%/y. Age, chronic renal failure, inactivity, and aortic valve velocity are independently predictive of all-cause mortality.},

  abstract = {Background To analyze the association between Scadding radiological stages of sarcoidosis at diagnosis and the disease phenotype (epidemiology, clinical presentation and extrathoracic involvement) in one of the largest cohorts of patients with sarcoidosis reported from southern Europe. Methods The SARCOGEAS-Study Group includes a multicenter database of consecutive patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis according to the WASOG 1999 criteria. Extrathoracic disease at diagnosis was defined according to the 2014 instrument and the clusters proposed by Schupp et al. Results We analyzed 1230 patients (712 female, mean age 47 yrs.) who showed the following Scadding radiologic stages at diagnosis: stage 0 (n = 98), stage I (n = 395), stage II (n = 500), stage III (n = 195) and stage IV (n = 42). Women were overrepresented in patients presenting with extrathoracic/extrapulmonary disease, while the diagnosis was made at younger ages in patients presenting with BHL, and at older ages in those presenting with pulmonary fibrosis (q values {$<$}0.05). Multivariable adjusted analysis showed that patients presenting with pulmonary involvement (especially those with stages II and III) had a lower frequency of concomitant systemic involvement in some specific extrathoracic clusters (cutaneous-adenopathic/musculoskeletal, ENT and neuro-ocular/OCCC) but a higher frequency for others (hepatosplenic), in comparison with patients with extrapulmonary involvement (stages 0 and I). The presence of either BHL or fibrotic lesions did not influence the systemic phenotype of patients with pulmonary involvement. Conclusions The key determinant associated with a differentiated systemic phenotype of sarcoidosis at diagnosis was interstitial pulmonary involvement rather than the individual Scadding radiological stage.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of cigarette smoking on the occurrence of sarcoidosis. Sixty patients were examined (17 smokers had 43 nonsmokers). A control group consisted of 60 healthy subjects (33 smokers and 27 nonsmokers). The study showed sarcoidosis to more frequently occur in nonsmokers. Apart from the confirmation that sarcoidosis is predominantly a disease of nonsmokers, our aim was to determine whether smoking has an effect on the extent, course and outcome of the disease. Thus, at the beginning of the study the following examinations were performed in patients with sarcoidosis: chest X-ray, functional respiratory tests, determination of arterial blood acid-base status, blood cells, elastase and C-reactive protein in serum, and the cellular component of the bronchoalveolar lavage. Chest X-ray, functional respiratory tests and acid-base component of arterial blood were repeated after one year. In our patients, hilopulmonary sarcoidosis was most frequent (66.7\%). No significant difference was found between smokers and nonsmokers according to radiographic extent of the disease. Analysis of the cellular component of the bronchoalveolar lavage showed significantly more macrophages and less lymphocytes in smokers. Analysis of serum indicators showed no differences between smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers and nonsmokers did not differ according to values of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). However significantly more nonsmokers had mild degrees of decreased FEV1 (75\%-60\%) at the beginning of the study, and significantly more smokers had a higher degree of respiratory pathway obstruction (60\%-45\% and less), both at the beginning and end of the study. At the beginning of the study, significantly higher values of residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC) were recorded in smokers. No statistically significant difference was found between smokers nad nonsmokers according to the extent of the disease, frequency of extrathoracic localization of disease and use of corticosteroids. Comparison of radiographic finding at the end of the study showed no significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers. There was no difference according to outcome, depending on the therapy used. Based on the results of this study the authors conclude that smoking plays a certain protective role in the occurrence of sarcoidosis, although smoking has no effect on the extent, course and outcome of the disease.},

Using data from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study, we examined the link between clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild Alzheimer’s dementia and progression to severe dementia or death. Method The Cache County Dementia Progression Study is a longitudinal study of dementia progression in incident cases of the condition. Survival analyses included unadjusted Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Hazard ratio estimates controlled for age of dementia onset, dementia duration at baseline, gender, education level, General Medical Health Rating, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE-ε4) genotype. Results Three hundred thirty-five patients with incident Alzheimer’s dementia were studied. Sixty-eight (20\%) developed severe dementia over the follow-up. Psychosis (hazard ratio=2.007, p=0.028), agitation/aggression (hazard ratio=2.946, p=0.004), and any one clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptom (domain score of ≥4, hazard ratio=2.682, p=0.001) were associated with more rapid progression to severe dementia. Psychosis (hazard ratio=1.537, p=0.011), affective symptoms (hazard ratio=1.510, p=0.003), agitation/aggression (hazard ratio=1.942, p=0.004), mildly symptomatic neuropsychiatric symptoms (domain score of 1–3, hazard ratio=1.448, p=0.024), and clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms (hazard ratio=1.951, p={$<$}0.001) were associated with earlier death. Conclusions Specific neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with shorter survival time from mild Alzheimer’s dementia to severe dementia and/or death. The treatment of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild Alzheimer’s dementia should be examined for its potential to delay time to severe dementia or death.},

  abstract = {Objective: Epidemiologic evidence suggests a positive association between body mass, adult height, and postmenopausal breast cancer. However, most studies have not been large enough to examine the association across a very wide range of body mass or height, and few studies have assessed the relationship between body mass or height and postmenopausal breast cancer mortality. Methods: The relation between body mass index (BMI) and height and postmenopausal breast cancer mortality was examined in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II), a large prospective mortality study of US adults enrolled in 1982. After 14 years of follow-up, 2852 breast cancer deaths were observed among 424,168 postmenopausal women who were cancer-free at interview. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate relative risks and to control for potential confounding. Results: Breast cancer mortality rates increased continually and substantially with increasing BMI (rate ratio (RR) = 3.08, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 2.09–4.51 for BMI ≥ 40.0 compared to BMI 18.5–20.49). If causal, the multivariate-adjusted RR estimates in this study correspond to approximately 30–50\% of breast cancer deaths among postmenopausal women in the US population being attributable to overweight. Breast cancer mortality also increased with increasing height up to 66 inches with RR = 1.64, (95\% CI = 1.23–2.18) in women 66 inches tall compared to those {$<$} 60 inches. Conclusions: Postmenopausal obesity is an important and potentially avoidable predictor of fatal breast cancer in this study. These results underscore the importance of maintaining moderate weight throughout adult life.},

We used the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and the Cox proportional hazards model to determine rates and predictors of cerebrovascular events and death among valve disease patients. Methods—This population-based historical cohort study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, reviewed residents with a first echocardiographic diagnosis of mitral stenosis (n=19), mitral regurgitation (n=528), aortic stenosis (n=140), and aortic regurgitation (n=106) between 1985 and 1992. Results—During 2694 person-years of follow-up, 98 patients developed cerebrovascular events and 356 died. Compared with expected numbers, these observations are significantly elevated, with standardized morbidity ratio of 3.2 (95\% CI, 2.6 to 3.8) and 2.5 (95\% CI, 2.2 to 2.7), respectively. Independent predictors of cerebrovascular events were age, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. The risk ratio of severe aortic stenosis was 3.5 (95\% CI, 1.4 to 8.6), with atrial fibrillation conferring greater risk at younger age. Predictors of death were age, sex, cerebrovascular events, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure, the greatest risk being among those with both congestive heart failure and cerebrovascular events (risk ratio=8.8; 95\% CI, 5.8 to 13.4). Valve disease type and severity were not independent determinants of death. Conclusions—The risk of cerebrovascular events and death among patients with valve disease remains high. Age, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis are independent predictors of cerebrovascular events, and age, sex, cerebrovascular events, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease are independent predictors of death in these patients.},

Studies on the relationship between PMR and cancer have yielded mixed results and have been limited by multiple factors. This study examined the association between PMR and development of cancer in a community cohort. Methods A population-based cohort of 359 patients with PMR diagnosed between 1/1/1970 and 12/31/1999 and followed to 12/31/2013 was assembled along with a comparison cohort of 357 subjects. Records of the PMR and comparator subjects were reviewed for details concerning diagnosis of cancer. The cumulative incidence of malignancy in patients with and without PMR, adjusted for the competing risk of death, was estimated and compared using methods of Gray. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the trends in malignancy over time. Results There was no significant difference in the prevalence of malignancy prior to PMR incidence date/index date between the two groups with prior malignancies in 41 (11\%) of patients with PMR, and 50 (14\%) of non-PMR subjects (p-value=0.31). As well, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of malignancy at 10 years following PMR incidence between patients with PMR and non-PMR subjects (cumulative incidence at 10 years ± SE: PMR 13.8 ± 2.0, control 13.1 ± 2.0; p-value=0.89). Conclusion There is no increased risk of malignancy in patients who are diagnosed with PMR when compared to subjects without PMR in this population-based cohort.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease that can develop via several pathways. Different CRC subtypes, identified based on tumor markers, have been proposed to reflect these pathways. We evaluated the significance of these previously proposed classifications to survival. Methods. Participants in the population-based Seattle Colon Cancer Family Registry were diagnosed with invasive CRC from 1998 through 2007 in western Washington State (n=2706), and followed for survival through 2012. Tumor samples were collected from 2050 participants and classified into 5 subtypes based on combinations of tumor markers: type 1 (microsatellite instability [MSI] high, CpG island methylator phenotype [CIMP] positive, positive for BRAF mutation, negative for KRAS mutation); type 2 (microsatellite stable [MSS] or MSI-low, CIMP-positive, positive for BRAF mutation, negative for KRAS mutation); type 3 (MSS or MSI-low, non-CIMP, negative for BRAF mutation, positive for KRAS mutation); type 4 (MSS or MSI-low, non-CIMP, negative for mutations in BRAF and KRAS); and type 5 (MSI-high, non-CIMP, negative for mutations in BRAF and KRAS). Multiple imputation was used to impute tumor markers for those missing data on 1-3 markers. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of subtypes with disease-specific and overall mortality, adjusting for age, sex, body mass, diagnosis year, and smoking history. Results. Compared to participants with type 4 tumors (the most predominant), participants with type 2 tumors had the highest disease-specific mortality (HR=2.20, 95\% CI: 1.47-3.31); subjects with type 3 tumors also had higher disease-specific mortality (HR=1.32, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.63). Subjects with type 5 tumors had the lowest disease-specific mortality (HR=0.30, 95\% CI: 0.14-0.66). Associations with overall mortality were similar to those with disease-specific mortality. Conclusions. Based on a large, population-based study, CRC subtypes, defined by proposed etiologic pathways, are associated with marked differences in survival. These findings indicate the clinical importance of studies into the molecular heterogeneity of CRC.},

  abstract = {Background: Mutations in the Kirsten Ras (KRAS) oncogene are common in colorectal cancer (CRC). The role of KRAS-mutation status as a prognostic factor, however, is unclear. We evaluated the relationship between KRAS-mutation status and CRC survival, considering heterogeneity in this association by tumour and patient characteristics. Methods: The population-based study included individuals diagnosed with CRC between 1998–2007 in Western Washington State. Tumour specimens were tested for KRAS exon 2 mutations, the BRAF p.V600E mutation, and microsatellite instability (MSI). We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between KRAS-mutation status and disease-specific and overall survival. Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, tumour site, stage, and MSI. We conducted additional analyses combining KRAS-mutation, BRAF-mutation, and MSI status. Results: Among 1989 cases, 31\% had KRAS-mutated CRC. Kirsten Ras (KRAS)-mutated CRC was associated with poorer disease-specific survival (HR=1.37, 95\% CI: 1.13–1.66). This association was not evident in cases who presented with distant-stage CRC. Cases with KRAS-wild-type/BRAF-wild-type/MSI-high CRC had the most favourable prognosis; those with CRC exhibiting a KRAS- or BRAF-mutation and no MSI had the poorest prognosis. Patterns were similar for overall survival. Conclusion: Kirsten Ras (KRAS)-mutated CRC was associated with statistically significantly poorer survival after diagnosis than KRAS-wild-type CRC.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to construct and validate a Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) for 1-year mortality from a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) routinely carried out in elderly patients in a geriatric acute ward. The CGA included clinical, cognitive, functional, nutritional, and social parameters and was carried out using six standardized scales and information on medications and social support network, for a total of 63 items in eight domains. A MPI was developed from CGA data by aggregating the total scores of the eight domains and expressing it as a score from 0 to 1. Three grades of MPI were identified: low risk, 0.0–0.33; moderate risk, 0.34–0.66; and severe risk, 0.67–1.0. Using the proportional hazard models, we studied the predictive value of the MPI for all causes of mortality over a 12-month follow-up period. MPI was then validated in a different cohort of consecutively hospitalized patients. The development cohort included 838 and the validation cohort 857 elderly hospitalized patients. Of the patients in the two cohorts, 53.3 and 54.9\% were classified in the low-risk group, respectively (MPI mean value, 0.18 ± 0.09 and 0.18 ± 0.09); 31.2 and 30.6\% in the moderate-risk group (0.48 ± 0.09 and 0.49 ± 0.09); 15.4 and 14.2\% in the severe-risk group (0.77 ± 0.08 and 0.75 ± 0.07). In both cohorts, higher MPI scores were significantly associated with older age (p = 0.0001), female sex (p = 0.0001), lower educational level (p = 0.0001), and higher mortality (p = 0.0001). In both cohorts, a close agreement was found between the estimated mortality and the observed mortality after both 6 months and 1 year of follow-up. The discrimination of the MPI was also good, with a ROC area of 0.751 (95\%CI, 0.70–0.80) at 6 months and 0.751 (95\%CI, 0.71–0.80) at 1 year of follow-up. We conclude that this MPI, calculated from information collected in a standardized CGA, accurately stratifies hospitalized elderly patients into groups at varying risk of mortality.},

  abstract = {HIV-infected individuals with access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are living longer and the causes of excess morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are becoming comparable to individuals without HIV infection. However, many PLWHA smoke cigarettes—a well known contributor to excess morbidity and mortality. To investigate the association between smoking and mortality among PLWHA during the HAART era (1996+), we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,108 PLWHA enrolled in Seattle and King County’s Adult and Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Study. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were obtained using Cox proportional hazards regression. Compared to never smokers, current smokers (aHR = 1.8, 95\% CI: 1.3, 2.3) and individuals with an increased dose and/or duration of smoking were at greater risk of all-cause mortality. Although additional research is needed to evaluate the full effect of smoking on cause-specific mortality, smoking cessation programs should target PLWHA to further increase their life expectancy.},

This is an extension study of our previous report on mortality. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients with a symptom onset between 1974 and 1984 were followed until the date of December 31, 2012 or death, representing a follow-up period of up to 38 years. Overall and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, and predictors for survival at disease onset were estimated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Two hundred thirty patients had died by December 31, 2012; a total of 3,489 person-years were available for observation. The SMR at 38 years of follow-up was 2.02 (1.76-2.29). Employing Cox's proportional hazard modeling, male sex, gait disorder, absence of classical rest tremor, and absence of asymmetry predicted poor survival in this cohort. Increased cause-specific SMRs were found for pneumonia and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous studies have relied predominantly on the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) to assess the association of adiposity with the risk of death, but few have examined whether the distribution of body fat contributes to the prediction of death. METHODS We examined the association of BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio with the risk of death among 359,387 participants from nine countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). We used a Cox regression analysis, with age as the time variable, and stratified the models according to study center and age at recruitment, with further adjustment for educational level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and height. RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 9.7 years, 14,723 participants died. The lowest risks of death related to BMI were observed at a BMI of 25.3 for men and 24.3 for women. After adjustment for BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were strongly associated with the risk of death. Relative risks among men and women in the highest quintile of waist circumference were 2.05 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.80 to 2.33) and 1.78 (95\% CI, 1.56 to 2.04), respectively, and in the highest quintile of waist-to-hip ratio, the relative risks were 1.68 (95\% CI, 1.53 to 1.84) and 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.37 to 1.66), respectively. BMI remained significantly associated with the risk of death in models that included waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that both general adiposity and abdominal adiposity are associated with the risk of death and support the use of waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio in addition to BMI in assessing the risk of death.},

  abstract = {Background Atrial fibrillation is associated with higher mortality. Identification of causes of death and contemporary risk factors for all‐cause mortality may guide interventions. Methods and Results In the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF) study, patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation were randomized to rivaroxaban or dose‐adjusted warfarin. Cox proportional hazards regression with backward elimination identified factors at randomization that~were independently associated with all‐cause mortality in the 14~171 participants in the intention‐to‐treat population. The median age was 73~years, and the mean CHADS 2 score was 3.5. Over 1.9~years of median follow‐up, 1214 (8.6\%) patients died. Kaplan–Meier mortality rates were 4.2\% at 1~year and 8.9\% at 2~years. The majority of classified deaths (1081) were cardiovascular (72\%), whereas only 6\% were nonhemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. No significant difference in all‐cause mortality was observed between the rivaroxaban and warfarin arms (P=0.15). Heart failure (hazard ratio 1.51, 95\% CI 1.33–1.70, P{$<$}0.0001) and age ≥75~years (hazard ratio 1.69, 95\% CI 1.51–1.90, P{$<$}0.0001) were associated with higher all‐cause mortality. Multiple additional characteristics were independently associated with higher mortality, with decreasing creatinine clearance, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, male sex, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes being among the most strongly associated (model C‐index 0.677). Conclusions In a large population of patients anticoagulated for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, ≈7 in 10 deaths were cardiovascular, whereas {$<$}1 in 10 deaths were caused by nonhemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. Optimal prevention and treatment of heart failure, renal impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes may improve survival.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate prognosis is vital to the initiation of advance care planning particularly in a vulnerable, at risk population such as care home residents. The aim of this paper is to report on the revision and simplification of the MDS Mortality Rating Index (MMRI) for use in clinical practice to predict the probability of death in six months for care home residents. METHODS: The design was a secondary analysis of a US Minimum Data Set (MDS) for long term care residents using regression analysis to identify predictors of mortality within six months. RESULTS: Using twelve easy to collect items, the probability of mortality within six months was accurately predicted within the MDS database. The items are: admission to the care home within three months; lost weight unintentionally in past three months; renal failure; chronic heart failure; poor appetite; male; dehydrated; short of breath; active cancer diagnosis; age; deteriorated cognitive skills in past three months; activities of daily living score. CONCLUSION: A lack of recognition of the proximity of death is often blamed for inappropriate admission to hospital at the end of an older person's life. An accurate prognosis for older adults living in a residential or nursing home can facilitate end of life decision making and planning for preferred place of care at the end of life. The original MMRI was derived and validated from a large database of long term care residents in the USA. However, this simplification of the revised index (MMRI-R) may provide a means for facilitating prognostication and end of life discussions for application outside the USA where the MDS is not in use. Prospective testing is needed to further test the accuracy of the MMRI-R and its application in the UK and other non-MDS settings.},

  abstract = {Background High-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is frequently upstaged after surgery and is associated with uniformly poor survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may offer a way to improve clinical outcomes. We compare the survival rates of UTUC patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery with patients who did not. Methods Retrospective review of patients with high-risk UTUC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in 2004–2008 (study group), compared to a matched cohort who underwent initial surgery in 1993–2003 (control group). The Fisher exact, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Kaplan-Meier methods were used. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate association of these two outcomes with patient, treatment, and tumor characteristics in univariate and multivariate models. Results Of 112 patients, 31 were in the study group and 81 in the control group. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had improved OS and DSS with a 5-year DSS of 90.1\% and 5-year OS rate 80.2\%, versus a 5-year DSS and OS of 57.6\% for those treated with initial surgery (p = 0.0204 and p = 0.0015, respectively). In multivariate analyses the neoadjuvant group had a lower risk of mortality (OS hazard ratio 0.42 [p = 0.035]; DSS hazard ratio 0.19 [p = 0.006]). Conclusions Neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with UTUC compared with a matched historical cohort of patients treated with initial surgery. Patients with high-risk UTUC should be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in view of the limited opportunity to administer effective cisplatin-based chemotherapy after nephroureterectomy.},

  abstract = {Background The current systolic blood-pressure threshold for hypertension treatment is 140 mm\hphantom{,}Hg for all adults. WHO and the International Society of Hypertension have propos that normal pressure be lower than 130 mm\hphantom{,}Hg, with an optimum pressure of less than 120 mm\hphantom{,}Hg. These recommendations are based largely on the assumption that cardiovascular and overall mortality depend in a strictly increasing manner on systolic blood pressure. The Framingham study was instrumental in establishing this viewpoint. We reassessed data from that study to find out whether the relation is strictly increasing or whether there is a threshold in this relation. Methods We used logistic splines to model the relation of risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death with systolic blood pressure, using age-specific and sex-specific rates. We tested for the independence of the slope parameters from age and sex, and the reduced model with common slopes was used to produce a model different from the conventional linear logistic model. Findings Against the predictions of the linear logistic model, neither all-cause nor cardiovascular deaths depended on systolic blood pressure in a strictly increasing manner. The linear logistic model was rejected by the Framingham data. Instead, risk was independent of systolic blood pressure for all pressures lower than a threshold at the 70th percentile for a person of a given age and sex. Risk sharply increased with pressure higher than the 80th percentile. Since systolic blood pressure steadily increases with age, the threshold increases with age, but more rapidly in women than in men. Intrepretation The Framingham data contradict the concept that lower pressures imply lower risk and the idea that 140 mm\hphantom{,}Hg is a useful cut-off value for hypertension for all adults. There is an age-dependent and sex-dependent threshold for hypertension. A substantial proportion of the population who would currently be thought to be at increased risk are, therefore, at no increased risk.},

Aim To assess determinants of long-term outcome in SAH. Methods Data were recorded from a cohort with SAH (admission Discriminant Function (DF) ≥32). Kaplan–Meier (KM) and Cox proportional hazards survival analyses were performed to determine predictors of outcome. Results One hundred and nine patients were included; 63.3\% male, aged 49.6 ± 9.4 years with median follow-up of 40.7 months (95\% CI 37.2–44.3). Median DF was 58, 86.2\% had cirrhosis and 65.1\% received corticosteroids and/or pentoxifylline. Overall mortality was 57.8\%, 96.8\% of deaths being liver-related and 65.1\% occurring after the index hospitalisation. Estimated 5-year survival was 31.8\%. Hepatorenal syndrome was the only baseline factor independently associated with mortality (HR 3.78, 95\% CI 1.98–7.19, P {$<$} 0.0001), although it predicted short-term, rather than long-term outcome (median survival 0.52 months, 95\% CI 0.43–0.61). Of the 87 patients (79.8\%) who survived index hospitalisation, 65.1\% experienced recidivism. Abstinence at last follow-up remained the only independent predictor of survival in multivariate analysis (HR 0.370, 95\% CI 0.168–0.818, P = 0.014). Five-year survival was higher in abstainers (75.3\%) compared with relapsed and continued drinkers (26.8\% and 21.0\%, respectively, P = 0.005). However, the survival benefit from abstinence only became statistically significant at 18 months postdischarge (HR 2.714, 95\% CI 0.995–7.404, P = 0.051). Conclusions Estimated 5-year survival after index hospitalisation with SAH is 31.8\% with alcohol relapse occurring in two-thirds of patients. Abstinence remains the only independent predictor of long-term survival. Novel strategies to improve abstinence after admission with SAH are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Background: The aim was to determine whether early open surgical repair would benefit patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysm compared with surveillance on long-term follow-up. Methods: The 1090 patients who were enrolled into the UK Small Aneurysm Trial between 1991 and 1995 were followed up for aneurysm repair and mortality until November 2005. Results: By November 2005, 714 patients (65·5 per cent) had died, 929 (85·2 per cent) had undergone aneurysm repair, 150 (13·8 per cent) had died without aneurysm repair and 11 (1·0 per cent) remained alive without aneurysm repair. After 12 years, mortality in the surgery and surveillance groups was 63·9 and 67·3 per cent respectively, unadjusted hazard ratio 0·90 (P = 0·139). Three-quarters of the surveillance group eventually had aneurysm repair, with a 30-day elective mortality of 6·3 per cent (versus 5·0 per cent in the early surgery group, P = 0·366). Estimates suggested that the cost of treatment was 17 per cent higher in the early surgery group, with a mean difference of £1326. The death rate in these patients was about twice that in the population matched for age and sex. Conclusion: There was no long-term survival benefit of early elective open repair of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. Even after successful aneurysm repair, the mortality among these patients was higher than in the general population. Copyright © 2007 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

  abstract = {Introduction Both smoking and alcohol consumption have been associated with modestly increased risks of colorectal cancer (CRC). Reports have suggested that these associations may differ by tumor molecular subtype, with stronger associations for microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) tumors. Methods We used a population-based case-unaffected sibling design including 2,248 sibships (2,253 cases; 4,486 siblings) recruited to the Colon Cancer Family Registry to evaluate the association between smoking, alcohol consumption and CRC. Associations were assessed using conditional logistic regression, treating sibship as the matching factor. Results Although there were no statistically significant associations between any smoking variable and CRC overall, smoking did confer an increased risk of certain types of CRC. We observed an association between pack years of smoking and rectal cancer (OR=1.85, 95\% CI 1.23—2.79 for {$>$} 40 pack years vs. non-smokers, p for trend = 0.03), and there was an increased risk of MSI-H CRC with increasing duration of smoking (OR=1.94, 95\% CI 1.09—3.46 for {$>$}30 years of smoking vs. non-smokers). Alcohol intake was associated with a modest increase in risk for CRC overall (OR=1.21, 95\% CI 1.03—1.44 for 12+ drinks per week vs. non-drinkers), with more marked increases in risk for MSI-L CRC (OR=1.85, 95\% CI 1.06—3.24) and rectal cancer (OR=1.48, 95\% CI 1.08—2.02). Conclusions We found associations between cigarette smoking and increased risks of rectal cancer and MSI-H CRC. Alcohol intake was associated with increased risks of rectal cancer and MSI-L CRC. These results highlight the importance of considering tumor phenotype in studies of risk factors for CRC.},

  abstract = {Objective We sought to objectively quantify the independent impact of significant mitral regurgitation (MR) on prognosis in patients with multiple comorbidities and ascertain the extent to which median survival is affected by increasing comorbidities. Methods This was a retrospective matched cohort study using a clinical-echocardiography reporting database linked to a clinical and administrative database in an Australian tertiary hospital. We identified our study cohort (patients with significant MR) and control cohort (without MR) on transthoracic echocardiographies performed between 2005 and 2010. The main outcome measures were mortality and heart failure rehospitalisation. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for clinical covariates and the ‘win ratio’ methodology was utilised to estimate the impact of MR on main outcomes. Results A total of 218 matched patients with and without significant MR were followed-up for 1\hspace{0.25em}year. Significant MR was associated with an adjusted HR for mortality of 1.83 (95\% CI 1.28 to 2.62, p{$<$}0.001). The win ratio for death and death or heart failure readmission was 0.57 (95\% CI 0.40 to 0.78, p=0.0002) and 0.53 (95\% CI 0.39 to 0.71, p{$<$}0.0001), respectively. Significant MR with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and age between 75 and 85\hspace{0.25em}years were associated with a substantial reduction in median survival by 2.3\hspace{0.25em}years. Significant MR with LV systolic dysfunction, age beyond 85 and advance comorbidities were associated with a lesser reduction in median survival by 0.2\hspace{0.25em}years. Conclusions Significant MR in patients with multiple comorbidities leads to increase in death and heart failure rehospitalisation with reduced estimated median survival. However, its impact diminishes with increasing comorbidities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite population declines in all-cause mortality, women with diabetes mellitus may have experienced an increase in mortality rates compared with men. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined change in all-cause, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular disease mortality rates among Framingham Heart Study participants who attended examinations during an "earlier" (1950 to 1975; n=930 deaths) and a "later" (1976 to 2001; n=773 deaths) time period. Diabetes mellitus was defined as casual glucose {$>$} or =200 mg/dL, fasting plasma glucose {$>$} or =126 mg/dL, or treatment. Among women, the hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality in the later versus the earlier time period were 0.59 (95\% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.70; P{$<$}0.0001) for those without diabetes mellitus and 0.48 (95\% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.71; P=0.002) for those with diabetes mellitus. Similar results were observed in men. Among women and men, the HR of cardiovascular disease mortality declined among those with and without diabetes mellitus. Non-cardiovascular disease mortality declined among women without diabetes mellitus (HR, 0.76; P=0.01), whereas no change was observed among women with diabetes mellitus or among men with or without diabetes mellitus. Individuals with versus those without diabetes mellitus were at increased risk of all-cause mortality in the earlier (HR, 2.44; P{$<$}0.0001) and later (HR, 1.95; P{$<$}0.0001) time periods. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in all-cause mortality among women and men with diabetes mellitus have occurred over time. However, mortality rates among individuals with diabetes mellitus remain approximately 2-fold higher compared with individuals without diabetes mellitus.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose It has been suggested that antipsychotic medication may be neuroprotective and may reduce post-stroke mortality, but studies are few and ambiguous. We aimed to investigate the post-stroke effects of preadmission antipsychotic use.  Methods We conducted a nationwide, population-based cohort study of 81,143 persons admitted with stroke in Denmark from 2003–2010. Using Danish health care databases, we extracted data on preadmission use of antipsychotics and confounding factors. We examined the association between current, former, and never use of antipsychotics and stroke severity, length of hospital stay, and 30-day post-stroke mortality using logistic regression analysis, survival analysis, and propensity score matching.  Results Current users of antipsychotics had a higher risk of severe or very severe stroke on The Scandinavian Stroke Scale than never users of antipsychotics (adjusted odds ratios, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.29–1.58). Current users were less likely to be discharged from hospital within 30 days of admission than never users (probability of non-discharge, 27.0\% vs. 21.9\%). Antipsychotics was associated with an increased 30-day post-stroke mortality among current users (adjusted mortality rate ratios, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.29–1.55), but not among former users (adjusted mortality rate ratios, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.98–1.14).  Conclusions Preadmission use of antipsychotics was associated with a higher risk of severe stroke, a longer duration of hospital stay, and a higher post-stroke mortality, even after adjustment for known confounders. Antipsychotics play an important role in the treatment of many psychiatric conditions, but our findings do not support the hypothesis that they reduce stroke severity or post-stroke mortality.},

  abstract = {Background Diffuse bronchiectasis (DB) may occur in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) mutations predispose RA patients to DB, but the prognosis of RA-associated DB (RA-DB) is unclear. Methods We report long-term mortality data from a nationwide family-based association study of patients with RA only, DB only or RA-DB. We assessed mortality as a function of clinical characteristics and CF/CFTR-RD (CFTR-related disorders) mutations in 137 subjects from 24 kindreds. Potential risk factors were investigated by Cox proportional-hazard analysis with shared Gaussian random effects to account for within-family correlations. Results During a median follow-up of 11 years after inclusion, 18 patients died, mostly from cardiorespiratory causes. Survival was significantly lower for RA-DB patients than for unaffected relatives and for patients with RA or DB only. RA patients with DB had also a poorer prognosis in terms of survival after RA diagnosis (HR, 8.6; 95\% CI, 1.5–48.2; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.014) and from birth (HR, 9.6; 95\% CI, 1.1–81.7; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.039). Early onset of DB (HR, 15.4; 95\% CI, 2.1–113.2; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.007) and CF/CFTR-RD mutation (HR, 7.2; 95\% CI, 1.4–37.1; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.018) were associated with poorer survival in patients with RA-DB. Thus, CF/CFTR-RD mutations in RA patients with early-onset DB defined a subgroup of high-risk patients with higher mortality rates (log-rank test P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.28×10−5). Conclusion DB is associated with poorer survival in patients with RA. Early-onset DB and CFTR mutations are two markers that identify RA patients at a high risk of death, for whom future therapeutic interventions should be designed and evaluated.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and identify predictors of prolonged survival in a population-based cohort of newly diagnosed patients. METHODS: An incident cohort from a population-based registry during the years 1998 through 2002 in Lombardy, Italy was followed until death or to February 28, 2013. Age, sex, date of onset of symptoms, site of onset, date of diagnosis, and El Escorial diagnostic category were collected. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox proportional hazards function was used to identify independent prognostic predictors. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to assess the 5-year and 10-year excess mortality of ALS patients. RESULTS: Included were 280 men and 203 women aged 18 to 93 years. Spinal onset ALS was present in 312 cases (64.6\%). Definite ALS was diagnosed in 213 cases (44.1\%), probable ALS in 130 (26.9\%), possible ALS in 93 (19.3\%), and suspected ALS in 47 (9.7\%). The cumulative time-dependent survival at 1, 5, and 10 years from diagnosis was 76.2\%, 23.4\%, and 11.8\%, respectively. Independent predictors included younger age, the diagnosis of possible/suspected ALS, spinal onset, and symptoms having started {$>$}12 months previously at diagnosis. SMR was 9.4 at 5 years and 5.4 at 10 years. SMR at 10 years was higher until age 75 year, predominating in women, and became nonsignificant for males thereafter. INTERPRETATION: The outcome in ALS varies with phenotype. Longer survival is predicted by younger age, spinal onset, male gender, and suspected ALS. After age 75 years, 10-year survival in men with ALS is similar to the general population.},

  abstract = {The objective of this observational, multicenter study was to evaluate the association of body mass index (BMI) with disease severity and prognosis in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. A total of 339 patients (197 females, 142 males) diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis by high-resolution computed tomography were classified into four groups: underweight (BMI{$<$}18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5≤BMI{$<$}25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0≤BMI{$<$}30.0 kg/m2), and obese (BMI≥30.0 kg/m2). Clinical variables expressing disease severity were recorded, and acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, and survival rates were estimated during the follow-up period. The mean BMI was 21.90 kg/m2. The underweight group comprised 28.61\% of all patients. BMI was negatively correlated with acute exacerbations, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, radiographic extent of bronchiectasis, and chronic colonization by P. aeruginosa and positively correlated with pulmonary function indices. BMI was a significant predictor of hospitalization risk independent of relevant covariates. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year cumulative survival rates were 94\%, 86\%, 81\%, and 73\%, respectively. Survival rates decreased with decreasing BMI (χ2=35.16, P{$<$}0.001). The arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, inspiratory capacity, age, BMI, and predicted percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 s independently predicted survival in the Cox proportional hazard model. In conclusion, an underweight status was highly prevalent among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Patients with a lower BMI were prone to developing more acute exacerbations, worse pulmonary function, amplified systemic inflammation, and chronic colonization by P. aeruginosa. BMI was a major determinant of hospitalization and death risks. BMI should be considered in the routine assessment of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of progress in cancer control at the population level is increasingly important. Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7·2 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81, 1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (\%) in the age gap since 1971. FINDINGS: The overall index of net survival increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index of net survival was 50\% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50\% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10\% survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1·1\% for pancreatic cancer to 98·2\% for testicular cancer. Net survival for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. INTERPRETATION: These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink for participants registered between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2013, we determined incidence, prevalence and mortality associated with bronchiectasis in the UK and investigated changes over time. The incidence and point prevalence of bronchiectasis increased yearly during the study period. Across all age groups, the incidence in women increased from 21.2 per 100 000 person-years in 2004 to 35.2 per 100 000 person-years in 2013 and in men from 18.2 per 100 000 person-years in 2004 to 26.9 per 100 000 person-years in 2013. The point prevalence in women increased from 350.5 per 100 000 in 2004 to 566.1 per 100 000 in 2013 and in men from 301.2 per 100 000 in 2004 to 485.5 per 100 000 in 2013. Comparing morality rates in women and men with bronchiectasis in England and Wales (n=11 862) with mortality rates in the general population from Office of National Statistics data showed that in women the age-adjusted mortality rate for the bronchiectasis population was 1437.7 per 100 000 and for the general population 635.9 per 100 000 (comparative mortality figure of 2.26). In men, the age-adjusted mortality rate for the bronchiectasis population was 1914.6 per 100 000 and for the general population 895.2 per 100 000 (comparative mortality figure of 2.14). Bronchiectasis is surprisingly common and is increasing in incidence and prevalence in the UK, particularly in older age groups. Bronchiectasis is associated with a markedly increased mortality.

  abstract = {Background Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and has been associated with 2- to 4-fold higher mortality. Diabetes mellitus-related mortality has not been reassessed in individuals receiving routine care in the United States in the contemporary era of CVD risk reduction. Methods and Results We retrospectively studied 963~648 adults receiving care in the US Veterans Affairs Healthcare System from 2002 to 2014; mean follow-up was 8~years. We estimated associations of diabetes mellitus status and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) with all-cause and CVD mortality using covariate-adjusted incidence rates and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Of participants, 34\% had diabetes mellitus. Compared with nondiabetic individuals, patients with diabetes mellitus had 7.0 (95\% CI , 6.7-7.4) and 3.5 (95\% CI, 3.3-3.7) deaths/1000-person-years higher all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively. The age-, sex-, race-, and ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes mellitus-related mortality was 1.29 (95\% CI, 1.28-1.31), and declined with adjustment for CVD risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.18 [95\% CI, 1.16-1.19]) and glycemia (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95\% CI, 1.02-1.05]). Among individuals with diabetes mellitus, CVD mortality increased as HbA1c exceeded 7\% (hazard ratios, 1.11 [95\% CI, 1.08-1.14], 1.25 [95\% CI, 1.22-1.29], and 1.52 [95\% CI, 1.48-1.56] for HbA1c 7\%-7.9\%, 8\%-8.9\%, and ≥9\%, respectively, relative to HbA1c 6\%-6.9\%). HbA1c 6\% to 6.9\% was associated with the lowest mortality risk irrespective of CVD history or age. Conclusions Diabetes mellitus remains significantly associated with all-cause and CVD mortality, although diabetes mellitus-related excess mortality is lower in the contemporary era than previously. We observed a gradient of mortality risk with increasing HbA1c {$>$}6\% to 6.9\%, suggesting HbA1c remains an informative predictor of outcomes even if causality cannot be inferred.},

Objective To examine the clinical correlates of flutter and its associated outcomes to distinguish them from those associated with AF in the Framingham Heart Study. Methods We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 electrocardiograms randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case-referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models. Results During mean follow-up of 33.0±12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72±10 years, 30\% women) developed flutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.54 to 5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD; 95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25; 95\% CI, 1.05 to 4.80) and heart failure (OR 5.22; 95\% CI, 1.26 to 21.64) were associated with incident flutter. In age- and sex-adjusted models, flutter (vs. referents) was associated with 10-year increased risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.01; 95\% CI, 3.14 to 7.99), myocardial infarction (HR 3.05; 95\% CI, 1.42 to 6.59), heart failure (HR 4.14; 95\% CI, 1.90 to 8.99), stroke (HR 2.17; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 4.17), and mortality (HR 2.00; 95\% CI, 1.44 to 2.79).

  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Introduction:}} Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterised by pain, functional deficits, nutritional and mechanical complications. Frequently managed in out-patient settings, the clinical course is unpredictable and requires multi-disciplinary care. There remains substantial variation in management. In contrast to acute pancreatitis, there are no globally accepted classification or severity scores to predict the disease course or compare interventions. We conducted a systematic review to determine the scope and clinical use of existing scoring systems. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} A systematic search was developed with a medical librarian using the Embase, Medline and Cochrane databases. Original articles and conference abstracts describing an original or modified classification or scoring system in CP that stratified patients into clinical and/or severity categories were included. To assess clinical application/validation, studies using all or part of a score as a stratification tool to measure another parameter or outcome were selected. Studies reporting on diagnosis or aetiology only were excluded. Four authors performed the search in independent pairs and conflicts were resolved by a fifth author using Covidence\textsuperscript{TM} systematic review software. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} Following screening 6,652 titles and 235 full-text reviews, 48 papers were analysed. Eleven described original scores and 6 described modifications of published scores. Many were comprehensive but limited in capturing the full spectrum of disease. In 31 studies, a score was used to categorise patients to compare or correlate various outcome measures. Exocrine and endocrine dysfunction and pain were included in 6, 5, and 4 scoring systems, respectively. No score included other nutrition parameters, such as bone health, malnutrition, or nutrient deficiency. Only one score has been objectively validated prospectively and independently for monitoring clinical progression and prognosis, but this had been applied to an in-patient population. \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} Available systems and scores do not reflect recent advances and guidelines in CP and are not commonly used. A practical clinical classification and scoring system, validated prospectively for prognostication would be useful for the meaningful analysis in observational and interventional studies in CP.},

Glandular damage from recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis can lead to irreversible changes characteristic of chronic pancreatitis. In recent decades accumulating evidence has defined longstanding pre-existing chronic pancreatitis as a strong risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The lag period between diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is usually one or two decades: pancreatitis appearing a year or two before the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is often the result of tumour-related ductal obstruction. The risk of developing pancreatic cancer appears to be highest in rare types of pancreatitis with an early onset, such as hereditary pancreatitis and tropical pancreatitis. Even though there is a strong link between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, over a 20~year period only around five percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis will develop pancreatic cancer. Until the development of more sophisticated screening procedures, screening is not recommended for patients with chronic pancreatitis.},

The primary goal of this study was to develop a predictive model that could be used in the pre-operative setting. Methods We pooled institutional databases from Memorial Sloan-Kettering and Mayo Clinic and identified 2,517 patients with renal masses and no concurrent evidence of metatases, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy and with complete data. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to model pre-operative clinical and radiographic characteristics as predictors for development of metastases following nephrectomy. Internal validation was performed with a statistical bootstrapping technique. Results Metastatic recurrence developed in 340 of the 2517 patients. Median follow-up for patients without metastatic recurrence was 4.7 years. A nomogram was developed using pre-operative characteristics to predict the 12-year likelihood of post-operative metastatic recurrence, with a concordance index (CI) of 0.80. In contrast, the concordance index of pre-operative TNM staging was 0.71. Size of the primary renal mass, evidence of lymphadenopathy or necrosis on pre-operative imaging and the mode of presentation were important predictors for the subsequent development of metastases. Conclusions We present a pre-operative nomogram that accurately predicts the development of metastatic recurrence following nephrectomy. This nomogram may be potentially useful to identify high-risk patients for clinical trials in neoadjuvant setting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the general population, obesity is associated with an increased risk of all-cause death. However, the importance of obesity in patients with established coronary heart disease is less well defined. METHODS: As part of the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, we performed a prospective cohort study of 1898 patients hospitalized with confirmed acute myocardial infarction between 1989 and 1994, with a median follow-up of 3.8 years. We assessed all-cause death through December 1995, using the National Death Index. We categorized patients according to WHO criteria for body mass index (BMI). We compared long-term death according to BMI (kg/m2) by using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Of the 1898 eligible patients, 607 (32\%) were normal weight (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2), 832 (44\%) were overweight (25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), 331 (17\%) were class I obese (30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2), and 128 (7\%) were class II or more obese ({$>$} or =35.0 kg/m2). A total of 311 patients died during follow-up. After adjustment for potentially confounding risk factors and excluding patients with noncardiac comorbidity, the risk for death appeared to increase linearly, with increasing BMI across all categories (P for trend =.08). The relative risk of death in all obese patients ({$>$} or =30 kg/m2) was 1.46, compared with those with normal weight (95\% CI, 0.98 to 2.17). CONCLUSIONS: We found that BMI appeared to have a positive, graded relation with post-myocardial infarction death. Whether weight reduction and secondary prevention strategies would reverse this effect in obese population remains to be seen.},

METHODS A multi-stage stratification cluster sampling strategy was used in this cross-sectional survey, and 20,245 subjects (8705 males and 11,540 females) aged 40 years or older were recruited, interviewed with a questionnaire, measured for height and weight, and tested with spirometry. 1668 subjects with post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 70\% were identified as having COPD after other known causes of airflow limitation were excluded. Analysis on relationship between COPD and BMI was performed in 1668 COPD and 18 577 non-COPD subjects. RESULTS Compared with non-COPD subjects, BMI was significantly lower in COPD patients [(22.7+/-3.5) vs (24.1+/-3.4) kg/m2, F=158.31, P{$<$}0.01]; BMI was also significantly lower in smokers than in non-smokers [(23.6+/-3.4) vs (24.2+/-3.5) kg/m2, F=49.10, P{$<$}0.01]. And an addictive interaction to BMI between COPD and smoking was observed (F=6.03, P{$<$}0.05). BMI decreased with the increase of the stage of COPD (F=45.6, P{$<$}0.01), with a negative relationship (r=-0.08, P{$<$}0.01). Lower BMI was significantly associated with increased risk of COPD (chi2=102.68, P{$<$}0.01). Compared with subjects with normal BMI (BMI=24.0-27.9 kg/m2), those with lower BMI (BMI{$<$}18.5 kg/m2) were more likely to have COPD [adjusted OR=2.12 (95\% CI 1.73-2.59)], while those with higher BMI (BMI=24.0-27.9 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI{$>$}or=28.0 kg/m2) were less likely to have COPD [adjusted OR=0.67 (95\% CI 0.59-0.76); and 0.60 [(95\% CI 0.49-0.73), respectively]. Moreover, there was an interaction to COPD between smoking and BMI (chi2=4.73, P{$<$}0.05). Compared with COPD patients with normal BMI, the quality of life in those with lower BMI was impaired (55+/-8 vs 57+/-6 in mental scores of SF-12, F=2.96, P{$<$}0.05; 42+/-10 vs 46+/-9 in physical scores of SF-12, F=4.21, P{$<$}0.01), and their dyspnea scores were higher (1.4+/-1.5 vs 1.1+/-1.3, chi2=14.32, P{$<$}0.01). CONCLUSION Lower BMI was strongly associated with COPD, possibly as a risk factor for COPD independent of smoking, and a potential predictor for COPD severity.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that depression in old age is associated with an increased mortality risk, but studies have also yielded inconclusive results. Possible moderators of the depression-mortality association in old age discussed in the literature are differences in cardiovascular morbidity, effects of multimorbidity, and increasing effects of subthreshold depression symptoms, such as minor depression and loneliness, on mortality. This study is concerned with the depression-mortality association in old and very old age. Information about mortality status and dates of death for 497 participants of the Berlin, Germany, Aging Study (mean age: 85.16 years; range: 70–103 years), a population based, age-stratified, longitudinal study, were obtained from the Berlin, Germany, City Registry for up to 15 years. The authors calculated proportional hazard regression models to examine associations between clinical diagnosis of depression at baseline assessment and subsequent mortality for young-old (70–84 years; N = 243; 68\% deceased) and oldest-old participants (85+ years; N = 254; 98\% deceased). In an additional step, the authors examined whether depression-mortality associations remained after statistically controlling for the effects of other mortality predictors including age, gender, education, dementia, cardiovascular risk factors, and other somatic diseases. Our analyses revealed strong predictive effects of depression diagnoses for mortality among the young old (Relative Risk = 1.60, 95\% Confidence Interval = 1.13–2.26) that were not due to the effects of other mortality predictors (Relative Risk = 1.56, 95\% Confidence Interval = 1.09–2.22). Among the oldest old, no depression-mortality associations were found. Depression is a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality in old age, yet the risk conveyed by depression does not hold in very old age. Possible underlying mechanisms in the very old are discussed.},

  abstract = {Summary Background The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease. Methods We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER (CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1·25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164371. Findings During 5·2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83\hphantom{,}098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90–114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60–74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1·44 [95\% CI 1·32–1·58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1·43 [1·25–1·63]), and stable angina (1·41 [1·36–1·46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1·08 [1·00–1·17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0·91 [95\% CI 0·86–0·98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1·23 [1·20–1·27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63·3\% (95\% CI 62·9–63·8) compared with 46·1\% (45·5–46·8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5·0 years earlier (95\% CI 4·8–5·2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43\%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19\% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years. Interpretation The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them.

We developed and validated prognostic models for all-cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary death in SCAD. Methods and results Models were developed in a linked electronic health records cohort of 102 023 SCAD patients from the CALIBER programme, with mean follow-up of 4.4 (SD 2.8) years during which 20 817 deaths and 8856 coronary outcomes were observed. The Kaplan–Meier 5-year risk was 20.6\% (95\% CI, 20.3, 20.9) for mortality and 9.7\% (95\% CI, 9.4, 9.9) for non-fatal MI or coronary death. The predictors in the models were age, sex, CAD diagnosis, deprivation, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, lipids, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, cancer, depression, anxiety, heart rate, creatinine, white cell count, and haemoglobin. The models had good calibration and discrimination in internal (external) validation with C-index 0.811 (0.735) for all-cause mortality and 0.778 (0.718) for non-fatal MI or coronary death. Using these models to identify patients at high risk (defined by guidelines as 3\% annual mortality) and support a management decision associated with hazard ratio 0.8 could save an additional 13–16 life years or 15–18 coronary event-free years per 1000 patients screened, compared with models with just age, sex, and deprivation. Conclusion These validated prognostic models could be used in clinical practice to support risk stratification as recommended in clinical guidelines.},

The aim of this study was to demonstrate a proof of concept that the density of melanoma cells at the position where the BT is measured is a morphological prognostic biomarker, which we name the Breslow density (BD). The hypothesis was that the BD has prognostic value for overall survival (OS) and is independent of the BT. Methods and results We analysed 100 cutaneous melanomas, and followed REMARK guidelines. The BD was the estimated percentage dermal area occupied by melanoma cells in a specified location. The BT and BD had a strong correlation (P = 2.1 × 10−11) but, despite this, they were independent prognostic factors for OS in Cox regression [BD hazard ratio (HR) 1.03, P = 0.001849; and BT HR 1.09, P = 0.000146]. This was corroborated by an independent effect on melanoma-specific survival. We assessed whether the BT and BD could be combined into a Breslow score. A prognostic index based on Cox regression coefficients was used, and this showed a marginal improvement in predicted 5-year survival as compared with the BT alone (area under the curve of 94.8\% versus 96.7\%). Conclusions We show a proof of concept that the BD represents a novel morphological prognostic biomarker that is independent of the BT, and that there is potential to combine these into a Breslow score. Larger studies are needed to validate the BD, but the simplicity of this biomarker makes it a strong candidate for translation to clinical practice.},

The aim of this study was to examine all-cause mortality risk in relation to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Methods. Data were extracted from a computerized central laboratory system for a defined geographical area over a 3-year study period. The eGFR was calculated using the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula and aligned to the MDRD laboratory. Average annual mortality and relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality was determined and compared for defined age and CKD bands. Results. 106\,366 participants (55.5\% female; 85\% White, 13\% South Asian, 2\% Black and others) were eligible and studied, representing 49\% of the Coventry adult population. 12\,540 (12\%) of the sample had some evidence of decreased kidney function, with an eGFR \&lt;60\,ml/min/1.73\,m 2 . 7611 (7\%) participants died and there were significantly elevated risks of mortality with increasing renal dysfunction; RR = 4.0, 8.3, 16.2 and 43.5 for eGFR 45–59, 30–44, 15–29 and \&lt;15\,ml/min/1.73\,m 2 , respectively. Within age bands, RRs were statistically significantly raised with CKD progression and within CKD stage, RR of death decreased as age increased. Conclusions. CKD prevalence increased with age and absolute and RR of mortality increased with progression of CKD. People aged over 75 years, with mild-to-moderate renal disease, representing 41\% of this age group, have no increased RR of mortality. Further study of CKD and mortality, particularly progression over time and with respect to age is needed.},

A retrospective review of all patients ≥65 years (481 patients with 525 primary melanomas) presenting with AJCC clinical stage I–II melanoma to an Australian cancer centre between 2000 and 2008. The median age was 74 years (65–94) with a male predominance (313 males, 65.0\%) and median tumour thickness of 1.90~mm (IQR~=~0.40–2.90, T1~=~33\%, T2~=~20\%, T3~=~24\%, T4~=~23\%). Inadequate surgical margins of excision ({$<$}10~mm) were common in older patients independent of site, thickness and ulceration (OR~=~1.04, 95\%CI~=~1.00–1.07, p~=~0.038). Inadequate excision margins were strongly associated with time to local recurrence, independent of age, thickness, ulceration and mitotic rate (HR~=~3.00, 95\%CI~=~1.49–6.03, p~=~0.0021), but not time to progression (p~=~0.10) or disease specific survival (DSS, p~=~0.27). Overall survival (OS) was strongly related to increasing age (HR~=~1.04, 95\%CI~=~1.01–1.07, p~=~0.015) and comorbid medical conditions (HR~=~1.26, 95\%CI~=~1.12–1.42, p~{$<~$}0.001), as assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI).

Older patients present with poor prognosis melanomas yet are less likely to receive adequate surgical excision margins resulting in higher rates of local recurrence. In melanoma patients ≥65 years, the increasing number of medical comorbidities explains much of the age related variations in OS and DSS and should be considered when planning treatment.},

Increasing body mass index was associated with an increased incidence of endometrial cancer (trend in relative risk per 10 units=2.89, 95\% confidence interval 2.62 to 3.18), adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus (2.38, 1.59 to 3.56), kidney cancer (1.53, 1.27 to 1.84), leukaemia (1.50, 1.23 to 1.83), multiple myeloma (1.31, 1.04 to 1.65), pancreatic cancer (1.24, 1.03 to 1.48), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.17, 1.03 to 1.34), ovarian cancer (1.14, 1.03 to 1.27), all cancers combined (1.12, 1.09 to 1.14),  breast cancer in postmenopausal women (1.40, 1.31 to 1.49) and colorectal cancer in premenopausal women (1.61, 1.05 to 2.48). In general, the relation between body mass index and mortality was similar to that for incidence. For colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer, the effect of body mass index on risk differed significantly according to menopausal status., Conclusions Increasing body mass index is associated with a significant increase in the risk of cancer for 10 out of 17 specific types examined. Among postmenopausal women in the UK, 5\% of all cancers (about 6000 annually) are attributable to being overweight or obese. For endometrial cancer and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, body mass index represents a major modifiable risk factor; about half of all cases in postmenopausal women are attributable to overweight or obesity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess bodyweight, expressed as increased body-mass index (BMI), is associated with the risk of some common adult cancers. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the strength of associations between BMI and different sites of cancer and to investigate differences in these associations between sex and ethnic groups. METHODS: We did electronic searches on Medline and Embase (1966 to November 2007), and searched reports to identify prospective studies of incident cases of 20 cancer types. We did random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of study-specific incremental estimates to determine the risk of cancer associated with a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI. FINDINGS: We analysed 221 datasets (141 articles), including 282,137 incident cases. In men, a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was strongly associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (RR 1.52, p{$<$}0.0001) and with thyroid (1.33, p=0.02), colon (1.24, p{$<$}0.0001), and renal (1.24, p {$<$}0.0001) cancers. In women, we recorded strong associations between a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI and endometrial (1.59, p{$<$}0.0001), gallbladder (1.59, p=0.04), oesophageal adenocarcinoma (1.51, p{$<$}0.0001), and renal (1.34, p{$<$}0.0001) cancers. We noted weaker positive associations (RR {$<$}1.20) between increased BMI and rectal cancer and malignant melanoma in men; postmenopausal breast, pancreatic, thyroid, and colon cancers in women; and leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in both sexes. Associations were stronger in men than in women for colon (p{$<$}0.0001) cancer. Associations were generally similar in studies from North America, Europe and Australia, and the Asia-Pacific region, but we recorded stronger associations in Asia-Pacific populations between increased BMI and premenopausal (p=0.009) and postmenopausal (p=0.06) breast cancers. INTERPRETATION: Increased BMI is associated with increased risk of common and less common malignancies. For some cancer types, associations differ between sexes and populations of different ethnic origins. These epidemiological observations should inform the exploration of biological mechanisms that link obesity with cancer},

  abstract = {Background In our ageing society, valvular heart diseases (VHD) have become an increasing public health problem. However, the lack of studies describing the impact of these diseases on the outcome of very old subjects makes it difficult to appreciate their real clinical burden. Methods Prospective, observational, population-based cohort study in Belgium. Five hundred fifty six subjects aged 80~years and older were followed up for 5.1\,±\,0.25~years for mortality and 3.0\,±\,0.25~years for hospitalization. Echocardiograms were performed at baseline. The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) was calculated for each subject. Results The prevalence of moderate-to-severe VHD was 17~\% (n\,=\,97). Mitral stenosis was more prevalent in women and an age-dependent increase of the prevalence of severe aortic stenosis was seen. The overall disease burden was higher in participants with VHD (median CIRS 3 [IQR 3–5] vs 4 [IQR 3–6] (P\,=\,0.008)). Moderate-to-severe VHD, and more specifically mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis, was found to be an independent predictor of both all-cause (HR 1.42 (95~\% CI 1.04–1.95)) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.13 (95~\% CI 1.38–3.29)). Moderate-to-severe VHD was also found to be an independent predictor of the need for a first unplanned hospitalization (HR 1.43 (95~\% CI 1.06–1.94)). Conclusions A high prevalence of moderate-to-severe VHD was found in the very old. Moderate-to-severe VHD was identified as an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and as well for unplanned hospitalizations, independent of other structural cardiac abnormalities, ventricular function and major co-morbidities.},

Sertraline, a SSRI used in the treatment of depression, interferes with eating behavior in animal models, but it has not been tested in obese humans. Aim of this study is the assessment of the effects of sertraline on eating attitudes and body weight in obese patients with and without mood disorders. A consecutive series of 65 obese out-patients aged 18-65 years, with a body mass index (BMI) {$>$} 30 kg/m2, was treated for 6 months with sertraline 150 mg/day per os, in addition to a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT). A consecutive series of 60 obese patients with similar characteristics, who were treated with CBT only, were used as control group. A greater reduction of BMI (mean +/- SD) was observed in sertraline-treated patients when compared to controls (from 35.3 +/- 5.7 to 32.0 +/- 5.4 kg/m2 in sertraline-treated patients, from 37.1 +/- 7.0 to 36.0 +/- 7.1 kg/m2 in controls; 6.5 +/- 5.4\% vs. 3.0 +/- 6.3\%; p {$<$} 0.01), while a similar change in eating attitudes (evaluated through the BITE questionnaire) was observed in both groups. Effects of sertraline on eating attitude and body weight were similar in patients with and without mood disorders. In conclusion, sertraline, administered together with CBT, seems to be more effective in inducing weight loss in obese patients when compared with CBT alone, and therefore it could be a useful tool in the first months of CBT for severe obesity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and metformin use with prognosis and outcomes of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 1117 patients with NMIBC treated at four institutions between 1996 and 2007. Cox regression models were used to analyse the association of DM and metformin use with disease recurrence, disease progression, cancer-specific mortality and any-cause mortality. RESULTS: Of the 1117 patients, 125 (11.1\%) had DM and 43 (3.8\%) used metformin. Within a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 64 (22-106) months, 469 (42.0\%) patients experienced disease recurrence, 103 (9.2\%) experienced disease progression, 50 (4.5\%) died from bladder cancer and 249 (22.3\%) died from other causes. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, patients with DM who did not take metformin had a greater risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.45, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.94, P = 0.01) and progression (HR: 2.38, 95\% CI 1.40-4.06, P = 0.001) but not any-cause mortality than patients without DM. DM with metformin use was independently associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence (HR: 0.50, 95\% CI 0.27-0.94, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Patients with DM and NMIBC who do not take metformin seem to be at an increased risk of disease recurrence and progression; metformin use seems to exert a protective effect with regard to disease recurrence. The mechanisms behind the impact of DM on patients with NMIBC and the potential protective effect of metformin need further elucidation.},

Descriptive cancer statistics include average annual Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program incidence, U.S. mortality and median age at diagnosis, and death for the period 1996–2000. Changes during the time period 1992–2000 are summarized by the annual percent change in SEER incidence and U.S. mortality data for this period. Five-year relative survival for selected cancers is examined by stage at diagnosis, based on data from 1990–1999. In addition, 5-year conditional survival for patients already surviving for 1–3 years after diagnosis is discussed as well as relative survival for other time periods. These measures may be more meaningful for clinical management and prognosis than 5-year relative survival from time of diagnosis. The likelihood of developing cancer during one’s lifetime is 1 in 2 for males and 1 in 3 for females, based on 1998–2000 data. It is estimated that approximately 9.6 million people in the U.S. who have had a diagnosis of cancer are alive. Five-year relative survival varies greatly by cancer site and stage at diagnosis, and tends to increase with time since diagnosis. The median age at cancer diagnosis is 68 for men and 65 for women. The 5-year relative survival rate for persons diagnosed with cancer is 62.7\%, with variation by cancer site and stage at diagnosis. For patients diagnosed with cancers of the prostate, female breast, corpus uteri, and urinary bladder, the relative survival rate at 8 years is over 75\%.},

METHODS A prospective cohort of 102 consecutive patients at their first diagnosis of CC were enrolled in this study. The clinical data and outcomes were compared to an age- and Child-Pugh class-matched cohort of 110 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. Diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, ultrasound/endoscopic parameters and, whenever possible, on histological grounds and transient elastography. All cases of cirrhosis without a definite etiology were enrolled in the CC group. The parameters assessed were: (1) severity of liver disease at the time of first diagnosis; (2) liver decompensation during follow-up; (3) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); (4) orthotopic liver transplantation; and (5) death. The independent associated factors were evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis, and survival and its determinants by the Kaplan-Meier model, log-rank test and Cox regression. RESULTS At the first observation, median age was 66 and 65 years and male gender was 36\% and 58\% for CC and HCV cirrhosis, respectively. CC showed Child-Pugh class A/B/C of 47\%/31\%/22\%, respectively. Compared to HCV cirrhosis, CC exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (12\% vs 54\%, respectively), overweight/obesity, high BMI, impaired glucose tolerance, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, cardiovascular diseases, extrahepatic cancer, and gallstones. Over a median period of 42 mo of follow-up, liver decompensation, HCC development and death for CC and HCV-related cirrhosis were 60.8\%, and 54.4\%, 16.7\% and 17.2\%, 39.2\% and 30\%, respectively. The median survival was 60 mo for CC. Independent predictors of death were age and Child-Pugh class at diagnosis. CC showed an approximately twofold higher incidence of HCC in Child-Pugh class A. CONCLUSION Undiagnosed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has an etiologic role in CC that is associated with a poor prognosis, early HCC development, high risk of cardiovascular disease and extrahepatic cancer.},

The current study analysed the mortality of 279 asthma patients and 869 COPD patients, who were seeking pension due to disability, and compared mortality rates with expected rates derived from the general population. The mean follow-up period was 13.3 yrs (range 2.5–22.4 yrs) during which time 96 (34.4\%) and 671 (77.2\%) deaths were identified among asthma and COPD patients, respectively. The average age at study entry was 46.8 and 56.6 yrs, and the average forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 68.8 and 44.1 \% predicted in the two diagnostic groups. After adjustment for predictors of survival (age, FEV1 \% predicted, chronic bronchitis, body mass index, smoking status, oral prednisolone, ischaemic heart disease, and cor pulmonale), the relative risk of death was 1.21 (95\% confidence interval: 0.77–1.89) and 0.98 (0.83–1.16) in females compared with males, in asthma and COPD patients, respectively. The standardised mortality rate (SMR) for males was 1.54 (1.10–2.09) and 2.7 (2.5–3.0), and for females 1.91 (1.44–2.49) and 4.8 (4.2–5.4), in asthma and COPD patients, respectively. Direct comparison of the SMR of males and females showed that females had higher mortality than males, with a rate ratio of 1.24 (0.82–1.84) and 1.8 (1.5–2.0), in asthma and COPD patients, respectively. Poisson regression analysis with control for the confounders did not change this result. Females and males with the same level of obstructive lung disease appear to have the same level of mortality. However, using standardised mortality rates, females have a higher mortality than males, suggesting that the protective effect of being female is lost in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.},

Objective To analyse the effects of smoking status, cumulative exposure, and time from smoking cessation on the prognosis of patients with primary non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Design, setting, and participants We collected smoking data from 2043 patients with primary NMIBC. Smoking variables included smoking status, average number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), duration in years, and time since smoking cessation. Lifetime cumulative smoking exposure was categorised as light short term (≤19 CPD, ≤19.9 yr), light long term (≤19 CPD, ≥20 yr), heavy short term (≥20 CPD, ≤19.9 yr) and heavy long term (≥20 CPD, ≥20 yr). The median follow-up in this retrospective study was 49 mo. Interventions Transurethral resection of the bladder with or without intravesical instillation therapy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Univariable and multivariable logistic regression and competing risk regression analyses assessed the effects of smoking on outcomes. Results and limitations There was no difference in clinicopathologic factors among never (24\%), former (47\%), and current smokers (29\%). Smoking status was associated with the cumulative incidence of disease progression in multivariable analysis (p = 0.003); current smokers had the highest cumulative incidences. Among current and former smokers, cumulative smoking exposure was associated with disease recurrence (p {$<$} 0.001), progression (p {$<$} 0.001), and overall survival (p {$<$} 0.001) in multivariable analyses that adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathologic factors and smoking status; heavy long-term smokers had the worst outcomes, followed by light long-term, heavy short-term, and light short-term smokers. Smoking cessation {$>$}10 yr reduced the risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.66; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.84; p {$<$} 0.001) and progression (HR: 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.22–0.83; p = 0.036) in multivariable analyses. The study is limited by its retrospective nature. Conclusions Smoking status and a higher cumulative smoking exposure are associated with worse prognosis in patients with NMIBC.

  abstract = {Background In the last two decades reports from different countries emerged associating pesticide and herbicide use with Parkinson's disease (PD). California growers use approximately 250 million pounds of pesticides annually, about a quarter of all pesticides used in the US. Methods We employed a proportional odds mortality design to compare all cases of PD recorded as underlying (1984–1994) or associated causes (1984–1993) of death occurring in California with all deaths from ischaemic heart disease (ICD-9 410– 414) during the same period. Based on pesticide use report data we classified California counties into several pesticide use categories. Agricultural census data allowed us to create measures of percentage of land per county treated with pesticides. Employing logistic regression models we estimated the effect of pesticide use controlling for age, gender, race, birthplace, year of deaths, and education. Results Mortality from PD as the underlying cause of death was higher in agricultural pesticide-use counties than in non-use counties. A dose response was observed for insecticide use per county land treated when using 1982 agricultural census data, but not for amounts of restricted pesticides used or length of residency in a country prior to death. Conclusions Our data show an increased PD mortality in California counties using agricultural pesticides. Unless all of our measures of county pesticide use are surrogates for other risk factors more prevalent in pesticide use counties, it seems important to target this prevalent exposure in rural California in future studies that use improved case finding mechanisms and collect pesticide exposure data for individuals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and sudden death. Identification of high-risk individuals beyond those with syncope or resuscitated sudden death remains a major challenge. METHODS: We assessed the value of clinical, electrophysiological, and electrocardiographic (ECG) features, including depolarization and repolarization metrics, in predicting arrhythmic events and sudden death in consecutive patients with BrS diagnosed between 2002 and 2013 in Quebec, Canada. Qualifying electrocardiograms with the highest type 1 ST-segment elevations were reviewed and analyzed by 2 electrophysiologists who were blinded to clinical history. Survival analyses were adjusted for Firth bias correction and left truncation. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients, 79.8\% of whom were men, were diagnosed with BrS at a mean age of 46.2 ± 13.3 years and were followed for 59.6 ± 16.4 months. Ten (9.5\%) had a history of cardiac arrest, 37 (35.2\%) had syncope, and 7 (6.7\%) experienced 20 arrhythmic events during follow-up, all consisting of appropriate ICD therapy (7 antitachycardia pacing; 13 shocks). In multivariate Cox regression analyses, a spontaneous type 1 electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern (hazard ratio [HR], 10.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-113.87; P~= 0.0476), maximal T peak-end (Tp-e) duration ≥ 100 ms (HR, 29.73; 95\% CI, 1.33-666.37; P~= 0.0325), and QRS duration in lead V6 {$>$} 110 ms (HR, 15.27; 95\% CI, 1.07-217.42; P~= 0.0443) were independently associated with VAs or aborted sudden cardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: In a multicentre cohort with BrS from Quebec, Canada, VAs and sudden death were independently associated with standard 12-lead ECG features, including a spontaneous type 1 pattern, depolarization (QRS in lead V6), and repolarization (maximal Tp-e duration) criteria.},

We extracted data on deaths due to non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis for 2001–2007 inclusive and stratified deaths by sex and age group. We used Poisson regression to compare mortality rates. Between 2001 and 2007, 5745 bronchiectasis related deaths were registered in England and Wales. When standardized to the 2007 population, this showed a rise in absolute numbers from 797 (2001) to 908 (2007). Statistical analyses suggested that the mortality rate is currently increasing at 3\%/year (p~{$<~$}0.001). Mortality rates were similar between men and women but there was a strong statistical interaction between age group and year (p~{$<~$}0.001) Rates were increasing in the two oldest age groups but falling in the three youngest groups. Currently just under 1000 people die from bronchiectasis each year in England and Wales. We found the number of deaths to be increasing at 3\% per year. Although overall mortality was increasing, rates were increasing in older groups but falling in the younger groups. These mortality rates may underestimate the burden of disease from bronchiectasis as lack of knowledge about the disease may lead to underreporting. These are also mortality rather than incidence data and may reflect improvements in treatment. Bronchiectasis therefore remains a significant concern. Clinical provision will potentially need to increase in order to care for this patient group.},

Our objectives were to examine the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed hypertension in Canada and compare mortality among people with and without diagnosed hypertension. Methods: We obtained data from linked health administrative databases from each province and territory for adults aged 20 years and older. We used a validated case definition to identify people with hypertension diagnosed between 1998/99 and 2007/08. We excluded pregnant women from the analysis. Results: This retrospective population-based study included more than 26 million people. In 2007/08, about 6 million adults (23.0\%) were living with diagnosed hypertension and about 418 000 had a new diagnosis. The age-standardized prevalence increased significantly from 12.5\% in 1998/99 to 19.6\% in 2007/08, and the incidence decreased from 2.7 to 2.4 per 100. Among people aged 60 years and older, the prevalence was higher among women than among men, as was the incidence among people aged 75 years and older. The prevalence and incidence were highest in the Atlantic region. For all age groups, all-cause mortality was higher among adults with diagnosed hypertension than among those without diagnosed hypertension. Interpretation: The overall prevalence of diagnosed hypertension in Canada from 1998 to 2008 was high and increasing, whereas the incidence declined during the same period. These findings highlight the need to continue monitoring the effectiveness of efforts for managing hypertension and to enhance public health programs aimed at preventing hypertension.},

Currently, around 1500 general practitioners with a population coverage in excess of 3 million, systematically provide their computerized medical data anonymously to ONS. Validation studies of the GPRD have documented the recording of medical data into general practitioners’ computers to be near to complete. The GPRD collects truly population-based data, has a size that makes it possible to follow-up large cohorts of users of specific drugs, and includes both outpatient and inpatient clinical information. The access to original medical records is excellent. Desirable improvements to the GPRD would be additional computerized information on certain variables and linkage to other health care databases. Most published studies to date have been in the area of drug safety. The General Practice Research Database has proved that valuable data can be collected in a general practice setting. The full potential of this rich computerized database has yet to come. This experience should serve to encourage others to develop similar population-based data in other countries.},

Prospective and historical cohort studies including a comparison of alcohol use disorder with a control group investigating all-cause mortality risk were included. Results This meta-analysis included 81 observational studies with 221 683 observed deaths among 853 722 people with alcohol use disorder. In men, the relative risk (RR) among clinical samples was 3.38 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.98–3.84); in women it was 4.57 (95\% CI: 3.86–5.42). Alcohol use disorders identified in general population surveys showed a twofold higher risk compared with no alcohol use disorder in men; no data were available for women. RRs were markedly higher for those ≤40 years old (ninefold in men, 13-fold in women) while still being at least twofold among those aged 60 years or older. Conclusions Mortality in people with alcohol use disorders is markedly higher than thought previously. Women have generally higher mortality risks than men. Among all people with alcohol use disorders, people in younger age groups and people in treatment show substantially higher mortality risk than others in that group.},

  abstract = {Introduction The Irish ALS register is a valuable resource for examining survival factors in Irish ALS patients. Cox regression has become the default tool for survival analysis, but recently new classes of flexible parametric survival analysis tools known as Royston-Parmar models have become available.  Methods We employed Cox proportional hazards and Royston-Parmar flexible parametric modeling to examine factors affecting survival in Irish ALS patients. We further examined the effect of choice of timescale on Cox models and the proportional hazards assumption, and extended both Cox and Royston-Parmar models with time varying components.  Results On comparison of models we chose a Royston-Parmar proportional hazards model without time varying covariates as the best fit. Using this model we confirmed the association of known survival markers in ALS including age at diagnosis (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.34 per 10 year increase; 95\% CI 1.26–1.42), diagnostic delay (HR 0.96 per 12 weeks delay; 95\% CI 0.94–0.97), Definite ALS (HR 1.47 95\% CI 1.17–1.84), bulbar onset disease (HR 1.58 95\% CI 1.33–1.87), riluzole use (HR 0.72 95\% CI 0.61–0.85) and attendance at an ALS clinic (HR 0.74 95\% CI 0.64–0.86).  Discussion Our analysis explored the strengths and weaknesses of Cox proportional hazard and Royston-Parmar flexible parametric methods. By including time varying components we were able to gain deeper understanding of the dataset. Variation in survival between time periods appears to be due to missing data in the first time period. The use of age as timescale to account for confounding by age resolved breaches of the proportional hazards assumption, but in doing so may have obscured deficiencies in the data. Our study demonstrates the need to test for, and fully explore, breaches of the Cox proportional hazards assumption. Royston-Parmar flexible parametric modeling proved a powerful method for achieving this.},

  abstract = {I. Executive summary  The purpose of this report is to provide pension actuaries and the Retirement Plans Experience  Committee (RPEC) with a literature review and an assessment of mortality improvement rates in  the  United  States  population.  The  report  addresses  the  following  topics,  which  were  of  particular interest to the RPEC:  * An overview of common mortality improvement projection models (section IV) and a more  detailed analysis of the U.K. Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) model (section V)   * A range of professional opinions regarding a long‐term estimate of mortality improvement  in the United States (section VI)  * The extent and interaction of age, period and year‐of‐birth cohort effects in U.S. mortality  improvement (section VII)  * External factors that might be correlated with variations in mortality improvement, such as  socioeconomic status and lifestyle (section VIII)  CMI model  The CMI uses a sophisticated framework that incorporates current rates using an interpolation  mechanism,  a  user‐selected  long‐term  mortality  improvement  rate,  and  a  formula  allowing flexibility in convergence periods. We did not find any specific reason this approach would not be appropriate for the United States population.  Long‐term rate of mortality improvement in the United States  Among the  wide range of opinions among academic researchers, all sources we studied agree  historical data shows some degree of continuous mortality improvement in the aggregate U.S.  population over the last century. However, we found researchers tend to fall into the extremes  —  assuming  either  a  maximum  age  to  human  longevity  or  future  lifespans  with  no  predetermined biological limit — with very little middle ground.   One of the few opinions that appears to have been developed in a balanced manner is the Social Security Administration’s 2011 Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods, which provides an implied  improvement  rate  of  1.26  percent.    We  believe  the  long‐term  intermediate‐cost  assumption  in  the  Social  Security  Administration’s  2012  Trustees  report  —  0.73  percent  provides  a  lower  bound  for  mortality  improvement  in  the  United  States.  Our  literature  search  was unable to find any reliable estimates of an upper bound.  Extent and interaction of age, period and cohort effects in U.S. mortality improvement  Recent  approaches  to  modeling  mortality  improvements,  including  the  CMI  methodology,  are based on projections by age, period and cohort (APC). Note that there is some lack of precision  in how the term “cohort effect” is used in longevity research. This report uses cohort effect as proposed by Yang (2008).  Cohort effects represent variations in mortality across groups of individuals born in the  same year or years. Cohort effects may arise when each succeeding cohort carries with  it the imprint of physical and social exposures from gestation to old age that bear upon  its morbidity and mortality risk in a specific way.  Evidence  suggests  that  APC  effects  exist  in  the  United  States.  However,  there  is  a  lack  of  consensus regarding whether a cohort or period effect has been dominant in particular causes  of death. Research indicates that a period or cohort effect is generally modest when the other  effects are simultaneously controlled. In section V of this report, we discuss further how the CMI  model incorporates APC effects.  Other factors that affect mortality improvement patterns in the United States  While  we  were  able  to  find  considerable  research  into  U.S.  base  mortality  rates  by  race  and  socioeconomic factors, we found very little on their effect on U.S. mortality improvement rates.   Socioeconomic factors. Research indicates that wealth, income, and education impact baseline  mortality and mortality improvement. Individuals in higher socioeconomic groups (identified by  level  of  education  achieved)  may  experience  aggregate  mortality  improvements  between  0.5  and 1 percent per year greater than the general population. There was no indication as to how  long this effect might persist.   Smoking.  Studies  continue  to  show  that  smoking  has  a  significant  effect  on  mortality  in  the  United States. While literature on U.S. population mortality improvement already accounts for a reduced  percentage  of  smokers,  research  supports  that  mortality  improvement  levels  for nonsmokers  are  significantly  greater  than  improvement  levels  for  smokers.  Moreover,  future  cohort effects are expected to appear as a result of changes in smoking behavior.  Obesity.  Lack  of  reliable  data  makes  it  difficult  to  quantify  the  long‐term  impact  of  increasing levels  of  obesity  within  the  U.S.  population  on  mortality  improvement.  Nevertheless,  studies  suggest that period effects will appear as a result of health campaigns impacting obesity levels at all ages in the next decades.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 6874 men aged 47 to 55 years at baseline and free of a history of myocardial infarction were followed with respect to mortality from coronary disease and from all causes over an average follow-up of 19.7 years, and with respect to non-fatal myocardial infarction for 11.8 years. High body mass index predicted death from coronary disease, but only at levels above 27.5 m.kg-2. Men with stable weight (defined as +/- 4\% change from age 20) had the lowest death rate from coronary disease and the lowest risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction. Relative risk of coronary death increased with increasing weight gain, from 1.57 (1.14-2.15) (after adjustment for age, physical activity, and smoking) in the group who gained 4 to 10\%, to 2.76 (1.97-3.85) in men with a weight gain of more than 35\% (P for trend 0.0001), compared to men who remained stable. After further adjustment for serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes, relative risks were reduced but still significantly elevated in all weight gain groups (P for trend 0.004). Data concerning non-fatal myocardial infarction were available for the first 11.8 years and showed a relative risk of 3.35 (2.05-5.47) after adjustment for age, physical activity, and smoking in men with a weight gain of more than 35\%. CONCLUSION: Weight gain from age 20, even a very moderate increase, is strongly associated with an increased risk of coronary death and non-fatal myocardial infarction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether to perform valve replacement in patients with asymptomatic but severe aortic stenosis is controversial. Therefore, we studied the natural history of this condition to identify predictors of outcome. METHODS: During 1994, we identified 128 consecutive patients with asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (59 women and 69 men; mean [+/-SD] age, 60+/-18 years; aortic-jet velocity, 5.0+/-0.6 m per second). The patients were prospectively followed until 1998. RESULTS: Follow-up information was available for 126 patients (98 percent) for a mean of 22+/-18 months. Event-free survival, with the end point defined as death (8 patients) or valve replacement necessitated by the development of symptoms (59 patients), was 67+/-5 percent at one year, 56+/-5 percent at two years, and 33+/-5 percent at four years. Five of the six deaths from cardiac disease were preceded by symptoms. According to multivariate analysis, only the extent of aortic-valve calcification was an independent predictor of outcome, whereas age, sex, and the presence or absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia were not. Event-free survival for patients with no or mild valvular calcification was 92+/-5 percent at one year, 84+/-8 percent at two years, and 75+/-9 percent at four years, as compared with 60+/-6 percent, 47+/-6 percent, and 20+/-5 percent, respectively, for those with moderate or severe calcification. The rate of progression of stenosis, as reflected by the aortic-jet velocity, was significantly higher in patients who had cardiac events (0.45+/-0.38 m per second per year) than those who did not have cardiac events (0.14+/-0.18 m per second per year, P{$<$}0.001), and the rate of progression of stenosis provided useful prognostic information. Of the patients with moderately or severely calcified aortic valves whose aortic-jet velocity increased by 0.3 m per second or more within one year, 79 percent underwent surgery or died within two years of the observed increase. CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis, it appears to be relatively safe to delay surgery until symptoms develop. However, outcomes vary widely. The presence of moderate or severe valvular calcification, together with a rapid increase in aortic-jet velocity, identifies patients with a very poor prognosis. These patients should be considered for early valve replacement rather than have surgery delayed until symptoms develop.},

In this study, 130 HD patients from an urban North American hospital were evaluated for depressive affect and then observed for up to 5 years. In a corrected Cox regression model, which held constant age, gender, dialysis vintage, illness severity and diabetic status, depressive affect emerged as a modest but significant predictor of mortality (relative risk\,=\,1.05, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.01–1.08). When the subjects were divided according to depressive affect severity, those with severe depressive affect had significantly shorter time to death (β\,=\,0.452, P\,=\,0.044). In a subgroup of 85 subjects, self-reported medication adherence was also predictive of mortality, with higher rates of nonadherence being associated with increased mortality risk. This paper lends support to the burgeoning literature on depression and reduced survival in HD populations, as well as begins the investigation of understanding the underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Summary Background The incidence of stroke is predicted to rise because of the rapidly ageing population. However, over the past two decades, findings of randomised trials have identified several interventions that are effective in prevention of stroke. Reliable data on time-trends in stroke incidence, major risk factors, and use of preventive treatments in an ageing population are required to ascertain whether implementation of preventive strategies can offset the predicted rise in stroke incidence. We aimed to obtain these data. Methods We ascertained changes in incidence of transient ischaemic attack and stroke, risk factors, and premorbid use of preventive treatments from 1981–84 (Oxford Community Stroke Project; OCSP) to 2002–04 (Oxford Vascular Study; OXVASC). Findings Of 476 patients with transient ischaemic attacks or strokes in OXVASC, 262 strokes and 93 transient ischaemic attacks were incident events. Despite more complete case-ascertainment than in OCSP, age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence of first-ever stroke fell by 29\% (relative incidence 0·71, 95\% CI 0·61–0·83, p=0·0002). Incidence declined by more than 50\% for primary intracerebral haemorrhage (0·47, 0·27–0·83, p=0·01) but was unchanged for subarachnoid haemorrhage (0·83, 0·44–1·57, p=0·57). Thus, although 28\% more incident strokes (366 vs 286) were expected in OXVASC due to demographic change alone (33\% increase in those aged 75 or older), the observed number fell (262 vs 286). Major reductions were recorded in mortality rates for incident stroke (0.63, 0.44–0.90, p=0.02) and in incidence of disabling or fatal stroke (0·60, 0·50–0·73, p{$<$}0·0001), but no change was seen in case-fatality due to incident stroke (17·2\% vs 17·8\%; age and sex adjusted relative risk 0·85, 95\% CI 0·57-1·28, p=0·45). Comparison of premorbid risk factors revealed substantial reductions in the proportion of smokers, mean total cholesterol, and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and major increases in premorbid treatment with antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and blood pressure lowering drugs (all p{$<$}0.0001). Interpretation The age-specific incidence of major stroke in Oxfordshire has fallen by 40\% over the past 20 years in association with increased use of preventive treatments and major reductions in premorbid risk factors.},

Patients 50 years of age or younger with a compatible sibling were assigned to undergo allogeneic transplantation; the others were randomly assigned to autologous transplantation or to consolidation/maintenance therapy for 2.5 years. Patients who did not achieve CR after induction had an overall survival rate of 5\% compared with 45\% for patients who achieved CR. Factors at diagnosis predictive of overall survival and disease-free survival were age (P = .001), white blood cell count less than 30 x 10(9)/L for B lineage or less than 100 x 10(9)/L for T lineage (P = .001) and immunophenotype, T lineage versus B lineage (P = .001). The data demonstrate that achieving CR with induction therapy is indispensable for long-term survival in adult patients with ALL. Furthermore, with a response rate greater than 90\%, the induction regimen was highly efficacious as remission-inducing therapy. This large database has validated several previously identified independent prognostic factors in ALL, such as age, white blood cell count at presentation, cytogenetics, and immunophenotype. However, the achievement of CR within 4 weeks does not appear to be an independent prognostic factor.},

  abstract = {Background Natural history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) is not very well documented. Clinical experience suggests that paroxysmal AF could progress to chronic AF with estimates ranging between 15 and 30\% over a period of 1–3 years. We performed an epidemiologic study to elucidate the natural history of paroxysmal AF, this study estimated its incidence in a general practice setting, identified associated factors and analyzed the progression into chronic AF as well as the mortality rate. Methods Using the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD), we identified patients aged 40–89 years with a first-recorded episode of paroxysmal AF during 1996. Risk factors were assessed using 525 incident paroxysmal AF cases confirmed by the general practitioner (GP) and a random sample of controls. We follow-up paroxysmal AF patients and estimated their mortality rate and progression to chronic AF. Results The incidence of paroxysmal AF was 1.0 per 1,000 person-years. Major risk factors for paroxysmal AF were age and prior valvular heart disease, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure and hyperthyroidism. During a mean follow-up of 2.7 years, 70 of 418 paroxysmal AF patients with complete information progressed to chronic AF. Risk factors associated with progression were valvular heart disease (OR 2.7, 95\% CI 1.2–6.0) and moderate to high alcohol consumption (OR 3.0, 95\% CI 1.1–8.0). Paroxysmal AF patients did not carry an increased risk of mortality, compared to an age and sex matched sample of the general population. There was a suggestion of a small increased risk among patients progressing to chronic AF (RR 1.5, 96\% CI 0.8–2.9). Conclusion Paroxysmal AF is a common arrhythmia in the general practice setting, increasing with age and commonly associated with other heart diseases. It sometimes is the initial presentation and then progress to chronic AF. A history of valvular heart disease and alcohol consumption are associated with this progression.},

To evaluate the role of co-morbidity and other factors on the risk of dying among AF patients. Methods We used the General Practice Research Database in the UK to perform a retrospective cohort study. We followed a cohort of chronic AF patiens (N = 1,035) and an age and sex matched cohort of 5,000 subjects sampled from the general population. We used all deceased AF patients as cases (n = 234) and the remaining AF patients as controls to perform a nested case-control analysis. We estimated mortality risk associated with AF using Cox regression. We computed mortality relative risks using logistic regression among AF patients. Results During a mean follow-up of two years, 393 patients died in the general population cohort and 234 in the AF cohort. Adjusted relative risk of death in the cohort of AF was 2.5 (95\%CI 2.1 – 3.0) compared to the general population. Among AF patients, mortality risk increased remarkably with advancing age. Smokers carried a relative risk of dying close to threefold. Ischaemic heart disease was the strongest clinical predictor of mortality with a RR of 3.0 (95\% CI; 2.1–4.1). Current use of calcium channel blockers, warfarin and aspirin was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. Conclusions Chronic AF is an important determinant of increased mortality. Major risk factors for mortality in the AF cohort were age, smoking and cardiovascular co-morbidity, in particular ischaemic heart disease.},

The EPHESUS trial enrolled patients with AMI complicated by heart failure. Patients from Canada, the UK, and the United States completed a Medical Outcomes Study–Depression questionnaire at baseline in addition to a comprehensive clinical examination. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms and outcomes, including 2-year all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death or hospitalization, adjusting for baseline clinical variables. Overall, 143 of 634 patients (22.6\%) had significant depressive symptoms at baseline (Medical Outcomes Study–Depression score ≥0.06). Depressed patients had higher 2-year mortality (29\% vs 18\%; P = .004) and cardiovascular death or hospitalization (42\% vs 33\%; P = .016). After risk adjustment, depressive symptoms remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.75, 95\% CI 1.15-2.68, P = .01) and cardiovascular death or hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.41, 95\% CI 1.03-1.93, P = .03). Results were consistent across demographic and clinical subgroups.

The overall prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 90 mm Hg, was 0.67\% among white men screened for MRFIT and increased with age (0.31\% among 35- to 39-year-olds to 1.7\% among 55- to 57-year-olds). The 6 year CHD and all-cause mortality rates in men over 50 were highest in those with ISH compared with both subjects with diastolic hypertension and those with normal pressure. The relative risk of death from stroke in those with ISH, compared with that in those with SBP less than 160 mm Hg and those with DBP less than 90 mm Hg, was 3.0 (95\% confidence interval 1.3 to 6.8). In addition, at any level of DBP, the level of SBP appeared to be the major determinant of all-cause and CHD mortality. The determinants of ISH in individuals under 60 years of age as well as the possible efficacy of its treatment should be evaluated further.},

Methods We studied adults 18~years and older with an incident diagnosis of hypertension from Alberta, Canada. We compared the prognostic performance of Cox regression models using Charlson comorbidities as time-invariant covariates at baseline (TIC) versus models including Charlson comorbidities as time-varying covariates (TVC) using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for testing goodness of fit. Results The strength of the association between important prognostic clinical variables and mortality varied by modeling technique; for example, myocardial infarction was less strongly associated with mortality in the TIC model (Hazard Ratio 1.07; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.05 to 1.1) than in the TVC model (HR 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.18 to 1.22). All TVC models slightly outperformed TIC models, regardless of the method used to adjust for comorbid conditions (individual Charlson Comorbidities, count of comorbidities or indices). The TVC model including all 17 Charlson comorbidities as individual independent variables showed the best fit and performance. Conclusion Accounting for changes in patient comorbidity status over time more accurately captures a patient’s health risk and slightly improves predictive model fit and performance than traditional methods using TIC assessment.},

We identified 512 cases of first-ever ischemic stroke [264 men (mean age 65.5?±?14.4) and 248 women (mean age 64.14?±?14.5)]. Subtypes of ischemic stroke were classified according to the TOAST criteria. Incidence rates were age standardized to the WHO and European populations.ResultsThe proportion of stroke subtypes was distributed as follows: 14.1\% large artery disease, 15\% cardioembolic, 22.5\% small artery disease, 43.9\% undetermined and 4.5\% other. The greatest overall incidence rates were attributed to undetermined infarction (49.97/100,000) followed by small artery disease (25.54/100,000). Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and atrial fibrillation differed among ischemic stroke subtypes. Overall, there were 268 (52.34\%) deaths and 73 (14.25\%) recurrent strokes at five years after incident ischemic stroke, with the greatest risk of recurrence seen in the large artery disease (35.6\%) and cardioembolic (35.5\%) subgroups. Survival was similar in men and women for each stroke subtype.ConclusionsWe observed markedly greater incidence rates of ischemic stroke subtypes than in other countries within the Mashad Stroke Incidence Study after age standardization. Our findings should be considered when planning prevention and stroke care services in this region.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metformin is an anti-hyperglycaemic agent used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes may present long-term complications: micro- (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease). Two meta-analyses have been published before, although only secondary outcomes were assessed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycaemic control, body weight, lipid levels, blood pressure, insulinaemia, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of multiple electronic databases and hand searches of reference lists of relevant trials identified. Date of last search: September 2003. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: Diabetes mellitus type 2, metformin versus any other oral intervention, assessment of relevant clinical outcome measures, use of random allocation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers extracted data, using a standard data extraction form. Data were summarised under a random effects model. Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risk. We calculated the risk difference (RD), and the Number Needed to Treat, when it was possible. We collected data of mean and standard deviation from changes to baseline. However many trials reported end point data. This limitation lead to the expression of the results as standardised mean differences (SMD) and an overall SMD was calculated. Heterogeneity was tested for using the Z score and the I-squared statistic. Subgroup, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included for analysis 29 trials with 37 arms (5259 participants), comparing metformin (37 arms and 2007 participants) with sulphonylureas (13 and 1167), placebo (12 and 702), diet (three and 493), thiazolidinediones (three and 132), insulin (two and 439), meglitinides (two and 208), and glucosidase inhibitors (two and 111). Nine studies reported data on primary outcomes. Obese patients allocated to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.009), and for all-cause mortality (P = 0.03). Obese participants assigned to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than overweight patients on conventional treatment for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.004), diabetes-related death (P = 0.03), all-cause mortality (P = 0.01), and myocardial infarction (P = 0.02). Patients assigned to metformin monotherapy showed a significant benefit for glycaemia control, weight, dyslipidaemia, and diastolic blood pressure. Metformin presents a strong benefit for HbA1c when compared with placebo and diet; and a moderated benefit for: glycaemia control, LDL cholesterol, and BMI or weight when compared with sulphonylureas. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Metformin may be the first therapeutic option in the diabetes mellitus type 2 with overweight or obesity, as it may prevent some vascular complications, and mortality. Metformin produces beneficial changes in glycaemia control, and moderated in weight, lipids, insulinaemia and diastolic blood pressure. Sulphonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, insulin, and diet fail to show more benefit for glycaemia control, body weight, or lipids, than metformin},

Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to analyze effect of body mass index on poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale {$>$}2) and mortality, respectively, within 90 days of stroke's onset.ResultsOf the 4811 patients (mean age 68·8 ± 12·2 years) included in the study, 2002 (41·6\%) were overweight, and 1095 (22·8\%) were obese. Overweight (body mass index 25?29·9 kg/m2) was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratios 0·59; 95\% confidence interval 0·51?0·68; P {$<$} 0·01) and decrease in poor functional outcome (odds ratio 0·74; 95\% confidence interval 0·64?0·85; P {$<$} 0·01) following acute ischemic stroke. The association of body mass index with stroke outcomes was dependent on age, gender, and use of thrombolytic therapy.ConclusionsBeing overweight or obese is associated with a better functional outcome and reduced mortality in patients of acute ischemic stroke.

Using the unified record system at the Mayo Clinic for the Olmsted County population, we reviewed all medical records with a diagnosis of PMR from 1970 through 1991. Results. There were 245 (173 female; 72 male) incidence cases of PMR between 1970 and 1991. The average annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence of PMR per 100,000 population ≥ 50 years was 52.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 45.9–59.2), with a significantly higher incidence in females (61.7; 95\% CI 52.3–71.2) than in males (39.9; 95\% CI 30.7–49.2).

However, accurate and representative data on time trends in its incidence and prognosis are not available. This study aims to provide nationwide population-based estimates of alcoholic hepatitis incidence and mortality in Denmark, 1999–2008. Methods We identified, from the Danish National Registry of Patients, all patients with a first-time discharge diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis from 1999 and through 2008. We also ascertained whether patients had cirrhosis. We computed the annual incidence rates as well as 28-, 84-day, 5-year, and 10-year mortality rates. Results We found 1951 patients with alcoholic hepatitis, 63\% men. During the study decade, the annual incidence rate in the Danish population rose from 37 to 46 per 106 for men and from 24 to 34 per 106 for women. The steepest increase was observed among middle-aged women. The 28-day mortality rate rose from 12\% to 15\%, and the 84-day mortality rate rose from 14\% to 24\%, similarly for men and women. The increase in short-term mortality was attributable to increasing patient age and prevalence of cirrhosis. The 5-year mortality was 56\% overall, 47\% without cirrhosis, and 69\% with cirrhosis. Conclusions The incidence of alcoholic hepatitis in Denmark has increased during the recent decade. The patients are older at diagnosis and more have cirrhosis, resulting in worse short-term prognosis. The long-term prognosis is grave, especially for patients with cirrhosis. The increase in incidence mirrors changes in alcohol consumption in Denmark.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims: The natural history of specific morphologic stages of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is not well defined. The aim of this study was to determine if worsening morphologic stages of CP are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 159 subjects with CP was performed. The baseline stage of CP was categorized according to the Cambridge classification. Pain was categorized as type A (intermittent acute), B (continuous), or combined. Exocrine failure was defined by steatorrhea; endocrine failure was characterized as diabetes mellitus. Complications were defined clinically. Results: Pancreatic duct (PD) morphology was equivocal in 37.1\%, minimal in 12.6\%, moderate in 7.5\%, and severe in 42.8\% of the patients. Over a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, the risk of developing exocrine insufficiency and diabetes was 28\% and 19\%, respectively. Recurrent acute flares of pancreatitis predicted the development of exocrine insufficiency (P = .004). Severe PD morphology predicted the likelihood of having persistent pain (P = .008). Patients with concurrent type A and B pain and older age at diagnosis had a greater likelihood of having persistent pain (P = .021). The risk of developing bile duct stricture was higher in the advanced morphologic stages of CP (P = .005). Conclusions: Recurrent flares of pancreatitis predispose to the development of exocrine insufficiency in CP. Patients with complex-type pain, older age at diagnosis, and advanced morphologic stage are more likely to have persistent pain.

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of past and projected future trends in adult overweight and obesity in OECD countries. Using individual-level data from repeated cross-sectional national surveys, some of the main determinants and pathways underlying the current obesity epidemic are explored, and possible policy levers for tackling the negative health effect of these trends are identified. First, projected future trends show a tendency towards a progressive stabilisation or slight shrinkage of pre-obesity rates, with a projected continued increase in obesity rates. Second, results suggest that diverging forces are at play, which have been pushing overweight and obesity rates into opposite directions. On one hand, the powerful influences of obesogenic environments (aspects of physical, social and economic environments that favour obesity) have been consolidating over the course of the past 20-30 years. On the other hand, the long term influences of changing education and socio-economic conditions have made successive generations increasingly aware of the health risks associated with lifestyle choices, and sometimes more able to handle environmental pressures. Third, the distribution of overweight and obesity in OECD countries consistently shows pronounced disparities by education and socio-economic condition in women (with more educated and higher socio-economic status women displaying substantially lower rates), while mixed patterns are observed in men. Fourth, the findings highlight the spread of overweight and obesity within households, suggesting that health-related behaviours, particularly those concerning diet and physical activity, are likely to play a larger role than genetic factors in determining the convergence of BMI levels within households.},

  abstract = {Kidney transplantation and wait-listing rates from the international Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS). Background The international Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS I and II) allows description of variations in kidney transplantation and wait-listing from nationally representative samples of 18- to 65-year-old hemodialysis patients. The present study examines the health status and socioeconomic characteristics of United States patients, the role of for-profit versus not-for-profit status of dialysis facilities, and the likelihood of transplant wait-listing and transplantation rates. Methods Analyses of transplantation rates were based on 5267 randomly selected DOPPS I patients in dialysis units in the United States, Europe, and Japan who received chronic hemodialysis therapy for at least 90 days in 2000. Left-truncated Cox regression was used to assess time to kidney transplantation. Logistic regression determined the odds of being transplant wait-listed for a cross-section of 1323 hemodialysis patients in the United States in 2000. Furthermore, kidney transplant wait-listing was determined in 12 countries from cross-sectional samples of DOPPS II hemodialysis patients in 2002 to 2003 (N = 4274). Results Transplantation rates varied widely, from very low in Japan to 25-fold higher in the United States and 75-fold higher in Spain (both P values {$<$}0.0001). Factors associated with higher rates of transplantation included younger age, nonblack race, less comorbidity, fewer years on dialysis, higher income, and higher education levels. The likelihood of being wait-listed showed wide variation internationally and by United States region but not by for-profit dialysis unit status within the United States. Conclusion DOPPS I and II confirmed large variations in kidney transplantation rates by country, even after adjusting for differences in case mix. Facility size and, in the United States, profit status, were not associated with varying transplantation rates. International results consistently showed higher transplantation rates for younger, healthier, better-educated, and higher income patients.},

There were 151 chlorambucil (CLB), 594 rituximab monotherapy (R-mono), 696 rituximab + intravenous chemotherapy (R + IV Chemo), and 1,544 IV chemo-only patients. Patients administered CLB and R-mono were the oldest and had the highest comorbidity burden while patients receiving R + IV Chemo were the youngest and had the lowest comorbidity burden (p {$<$} 0.0001). In the multivariate survival analysis, receipt of R + IV Chemo was associated with significantly lower mortality risk vs. IV Chemo-only (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.73; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–0.87) and a non-significant mortality risk reduction with R-mono vs. CLB (HR = 0.47; 95 \% CI: 0.21-1.05). Older age and increasing comorbidity score were significantly associated with higher mortality. These findings suggest that chemoimmunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy in an elderly population with a high prevalence of comorbidity, and this extends the conclusions from clinical trials in younger, medically fit patients.},

Participants of the CML Study IV, a randomized 5-arm trial designed to optimize imatinib therapy, were analyzed for comorbidities at diagnosis using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); 511 indexed comorbidities were reported in 1519 CML patients. Age was an additional risk factor in 863 patients. Resulting CCI scores were as follows: CCI 2, n = 589; CCI 3 or 4, n = 599; CCI 5 or 6, n = 229; and CCI ≥ 7, n = 102. No differences in cumulative incidences of accelerated phase, blast crisis, or remission rates were observed between patients in the different CCI groups. Higher CCI was significantly associated with lower OS probabilities. The 8-year OS probabilities were 93.6\%, 89.4\%, 77.6\%, and 46.4\% for patients with CCI 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, and ≥7, respectively. In multivariate analysis, CCI was the most powerful predictor of OS, which was still valid after removal of its age-related components. Comorbidities have no impact on treatment success but do have a negative effect on OS, indicating that survival of patients with CML is determined more by comorbidities than by CML itself. OS may therefore be inappropriate as an outcome measure for specific CML treatments. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00055874.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have an increased risk of falling that has yet to be fully explained. To better understand the gait disturbance in PD and the factors that contribute to falls, we quantitatively evaluated: (1) the relationship between gait variability (a marker of fall risk in other populations), fall history, and other parkinsonian features, and (2) the effects of levodopa on these relationships. METHODS: The average stride time and stride-to-stride variability were measured using force-sensitive insoles during comfortable walking. Fall frequency, motor control, function, and mental health were measured using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and the timed motor tests of the Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations (CAPIT) in 32 subjects with idiopathic PD, in an "off" (unmedicated) state and again in an "on" (medicated) state. RESULTS: Average stride time was not associated with any UPDRS or CAPIT measure and was similar in fallers and non-fallers in "off" and "on" states (p{$>$}0.27). Stride time variability was significantly associated with fall frequency as well as with total scores on the CAPIT and the UPDRS, ADL abilities, and motor function. Stride time variability and falls were not related to tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia in the "off" state. 41\% of subjects reported one or more falls. Stride time variability was 8.8+/-7.9\% in fallers and 4.2+/-1.3\% in non-fallers (p{$<$}0.009). Stride time variability significantly improved in response to levodopa, both in fallers and non-fallers, but remained increased in fallers (vs. non-fallers). CONCLUSIONS: The patho-physiology responsible for impaired stride-to-stride regulation of gait timing is apparently independent of other cardinal features of PD, i.e., tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia, but is responsive to levodopa. Stride-to-stride variability is especially impaired among PD subjects with a history of falls, suggesting, for the first time, the possibility of exaggerated impairment of internal clock function in PD fallers.},

To evaluate the impact of additional family history, we examined the associations between various family history definitions and early-onset CHD. METHODS: By using the national HealthStyles 2003 survey data, we assessed associations between self-reported family history and personal history of early-onset CHD (diagnosed at or before age 60 years), adjusting for demographics, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and obesity. RESULTS: Of 4,035 respondents, 60\% were female and 72\% were white, with a mean age of 48.8 years; 4.4\% had early-onset CHD. In addition to having at least one first-degree relative with early-onset CHD, other significant associations included having at least one first-degree relative with late-onset CHD, at least one second-degree relative with early-onset CHD, and two or more affected second-degree relatives regardless of age of onset of CHD. Early-onset stroke in at least one first-degree relative and, in women, having at least one first-degree relative with diabetes were also significantly associated with early-onset CHD. CONCLUSIONS: Family history beyond early-onset CHD in first-degree relatives is significantly associated with prevalent CHD diagnosed at or before age 60 years},

Design Nationwide population based cohort study using medical registries. Setting All hospitals in Denmark. Subjects 234 331 patients with a first time hospitalisation for myocardial infarction from 1984 through 2008. Main outcome measures Standardised incidence rate of myocardial infarction and 30 day and 31–365 day mortality by sex. Comorbidity categories were defined as normal, moderate, severe, and very severe according to the Charlson comorbidity index, and were compared by means of mortality rate ratios based on Cox regression. Results The standardised incidence rate per 100 000 people decreased in the 25 year period by 37\% for women (from 209 to 131) and by 48\% for men (from 410 to 213). The 30 day, 31–365 day, and one year mortality declined from 31.4\%, 15.6\%, and 42.1\% in 1984–8 to 14.8\%, 11.1\%, and 24.2\% in 2004–8, respectively. After adjustment for age at time of myocardial infarction, men and women had the same one year risk of dying. The mortality reduction was independent of comorbidity category. Comparing patients with very severe versus normal comorbidity during 2004–8, the mortality rate ratio, adjusted for age and sex, was 1.96 (95\% CI 1.83 to 2.11) within 30 days and 3.89 (3.58 to 4.24) within 31–365 days. Conclusions The rate of first time hospitalisation for myocardial infarction and subsequent short term mortality both declined by nearly half between 1984 and 2008. The reduction in mortality occurred for all patients, independent of sex and comorbidity. However, comorbidity burden was a strong prognostic factor for short and long term mortality, while sex was not.},

However, augmented life expectancy and increasing health care expenditures have led to questions concerning the routine use of electrotherapy in very elderly patients. This study is aimed at assessing data on the actual number, characteristics, and survival of patients requiring pacing therapy at age ≥80 years. Methods Between 1971 and 2000, 1588 patients aged ≥80 years completed a standardized 6- to 12-month follow-up after pacemaker (PM) implantation, resulting in a total of 5244 patient years. Kaplan-Meier analyses were computed to visualize survival differences in various subgroups and implantation periods. Results Today, patients aged ≥80 years account for 32\% of all PM implantations. An increasing 5-year survival after PM implantation to the current rate of 66\% was found, compared to 37\% and 47\% in the previous decades. Based on a mean survival time of 8 years, clinical symptoms can be effectively treated with costs of ≤\$500 per patient per year. Prognostic parameters were the decade of implantation (relative risk [RR] 0.80, CI 0.67–0.96, P ≤ .02), a history of presyncope (RR 0.73, CI 0.57–0.95, P ≤ .02), and male sex (RR 1.20, CI 1.04–1.40, P ≤ .02). However, none of these parameters can be recommended for estimating outcome or for guiding device selection. Conclusions Patients aged ≥80 years account for an increasing portion of PM implantations. Considering the remaining life expectancy of 8 years in these patients, PM therapy is a clinically and economically effective therapeutic option to control bradyarrhythmia-related symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background The association between depression and increased mortality risk in older persons may depend on the severity of the depressive disorder and gender. Aims To investigate the association between major and mild depressive syndromes and excess mortality in community-living elderly men and women. Method Depression (Geriatric Mental State AGECAT) was assessed in 4051 older persons, with a 6-year follow-up of community death registers. The mortality risk of neurotic and psychotic depression was calculated after adjustment for demographic variables, physical illness, cognitive decline and functional disabilities. Results A total of 75\% of men and 41\% of women with psychotic depression had died at follow-up. Psychotic depression was associated with significant excess mortality in both men and women. Neurotic depression was associated with a 1.67-fold higher mortality risk in men only. Conclusions In the elderly, major depressive syndromes increase the risk of death in both men and women, but mild depression increases the risk of death only in men.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Our aims were to determine the pace of change in cardiovascular risk factors by age, gender and socioeconomic groups from 1994 to 2008, and quantify the magnitude, direction and change in absolute and relative inequalities. METHODS Time trend analysis was used to measure change in absolute and relative inequalities in risk factors by gender and age (16-54, ≥ 55 years), using repeated cross-sectional data from the Health Survey for England 1994-2008. Seven risk factors were examined: smoking, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, consumption of five or more daily portions of fruit and vegetables, and physical activity. Socioeconomic group was measured using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007. RESULTS Between 1994 and 2008, the prevalence of smoking, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol decreased in most deprivation quintiles. However, obesity and diabetes increased. Increasing absolute inequalities were found in obesity in older men and women (p = 0.044 and p = 0.027 respectively), diabetes in young men and older women (p = 0.036 and p = 0.019 respectively), and physical activity in older women (p = 0.025). Relative inequality increased in high blood pressure in young women (p = 0.005). The prevalence of raised cholesterol showed widening absolute and relative inverse gradients from 1998 onwards in older men (p = 0.004 and p ≤ 0.001 respectively) and women (p ≤ 0.001 and p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Favourable trends in smoking, blood pressure and cholesterol are consistent with falling coronary heart disease death rates. However, adverse trends in obesity and diabetes are likely to counteract some of these gains. Furthermore, little progress over the last 15 years has been made towards reducing inequalities. Implementation of known effective population based approaches in combination with interventions targeted at individuals/subgroups with poorer cardiovascular risk profiles are therefore recommended to reduce social inequalities.},

DESIGN: A comparison of the performance of the index in predicting mortality among new respondents to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, 2001-2004) with that of respondents from the original development and validation cohorts (1997-2000) and a test of its performance over extended follow-up (up to 9 years) using the original cohorts. Follow-up mortality data were available through 2006. SETTING: NHIS. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two thousand fifty-seven new respondents to the NHIS (2001-2004) and 24,139 respondents from the original development and validation cohorts (1997-2000). MEASUREMENTS: A risk score was calculated for each respondent based on the presence or absence of 11 factors (function, illnesses, behaviors, demographics) that make up the index. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, 5-year mortality estimates were computed for the new and original cohort respondents and 9-year mortality estimates for the original cohorts. RESULTS: New respondents were similar to original cohort respondents but were slightly more likely to be aged 85 and older, report diabetes mellitus, and have a body mass index of 25.0 kg/m² or greater. The model performed as well in the new cohort as it had in the original cohort. New respondents with risk scores of 0 to 1 had a 2\% risk of 5-year mortality, whereas respondents who scored 18 or higher had a 69\% risk of 5-year mortality (range 3-71\% risk of 5-year mortality in the development cohort). The index also demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination in predicting 9-year mortality (range 7\% risk for scores of 0-1 to 92\% risk for scores of ≥ 18, original validation cohort extended). CONCLUSION: These results further justify use of this index to estimate life expectancy in clinical decision-making.},

Design/Setting Examination of the performance of a previously developed index in predicting 10- and 14-year mortality among respondents to the 1997–2000 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) using the original development and validation cohorts. Follow-up mortality data are now available through 2011. Participants 16,063 respondents from the original development cohort and 8,027 respondents from the original validation cohort. All participants were community dwelling and ≥65 years old. Measurements We calculated risk scores for each respondent based on the presence or absence of 11 factors (function, illnesses, behaviors, demographics) that make up the index. Using the Kaplan Meier method, we computed 10- and 14-year mortality estimates for the development and validation cohorts to examine model calibration. We examined model discrimination using the c-index. Results Participants in the development and validation cohorts were similar. Participants with risk scores 0–4 had 23\% risk of 14-year mortality whereas respondents with risk scores (13+) had 89\% risk of 14-year mortality. The c-index of the model in both cohorts was 0.73 for predicting 10-year mortality and 0.72 for predicting 14-year mortality. Overall, 18.4\% of adults 65–74 years and 60.2\% of adults ≥75 years have {$>$}50\% risk of mortality in 10 years. Conclusions Our index demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination in predicting 10- and 14-year mortality among community-dwelling US adults ≥65 years. Information on long-term prognosis is needed to help clinicians and older adults make more informed person-centered medical decisions and to help older adults plan for the future.},

Mean body mass indices (BMIs) were 25.6 +/- 3.3 and 23.8 +/- 4.1 kg/m2 in men and women, respectively. There was a graded and continuous positive interaction in both men and women between BMI, age and serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol tended to increase with age, but decreased in graded fashion with increases in BMI in both sexes. Triglyceride increased with BMI in both sexes and with age in women, but decreased in the older age groups of overweight and obese men. Though fasting blood glucose increased with age and BMI in both sexes, the increase was more marked in women. Among the 10,856 men aged 36-65 years at study entry, 313 deaths occurred within a follow-up period of 7.1 +/- 2.4 years. Among these men, increased mortality was seen at high BMIs in both smokers and non-smokers and was caused by coronary heart disease (CHD). Increased mortality at low BMI was seen in smokers but not in non-smokers and was due to an increase in cancer deaths. The BMI-associated increase in CHD death was completely accounted for by the factors contained in the Munster Heart Study (PROCAM) risk algorithm, indicating that the effect of overweight and obesity on CHD is mediated via other risk factors},

We carried out a retrospective multivariate analysis of 713 patients with ALS over a 20-year period from the South-East England Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (SEALS) population register. Patients were randomly allocated to 'discovery' or 'test' cohorts. A prognostic score was calculated using the discovery cohort and then used to predict survival in the test cohort. The score was used as a predictor variable to split the test cohort in four prognostic categories (good, moderate, average, poor). The accuracy of the score in predicting survival was tested by checking whether the predicted survival fell within the actual survival tertile which that patient was in. A prognostic score generated from one cohort of patients predicted survival for a second cohort of patients (r(2) =\,0.72). Six variables were included in the survival model: age at onset, diagnostic delay, El Escorial category, use of riluzole, gender and site of onset. Cox regression demonstrated a strong relationship between these variables and survival (χ(2) 80.8, df 1, p {$<$}\,0.0001, n =\,343) in the test cohort. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant difference in survival between clinical categories (log rank 161.932, df 3, p {$<$}\,0.001), and the prognostic score generated for the test cohort accurately predicted survival in 64\% of the patients. In conclusion, it is possible to correctly classify patients into prognostic categories using clinical data easily available at time of diagnosis.},

A systematic review was performed utilizing a Medline search with Mesh keywords ‘endometrial neoplasms’ and (‘body mass index’ or ‘obesity’) and (‘survival analysis’ or ‘mortality’ or ‘survivor’ or ‘survival’) for studies published prior to June 2013. Inclusion criteria included studies that assessed associations between BMI and survival in endometrial cancer patients. Two investigators independently reviewed the title and abstract and full-text of articles for inclusion or exclusion decision; discordant decisions were adjudicated by a third reviewer. A random-effects model was constructed that was comparable to the standard random-effects models used in the meta-analysis of odds ratios. The model was fitted using SAS PROC NLMIXED. 1451 studies were identified and reviewed in duplicate, 18 met inclusion criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated significantly higher odds of mortality with increasing BMI in endometrial cancer patients. Specifically the odds ratios were 1.01, 1.17, 1.26, and 1.66 for BMI categories of 25–29.9, 30–34.9, 35–39.9, and 40+, respectively.

The addition of rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy (R-CHOP)has led to a marked improvement in survival and has called into question the significance of previously recognized prognostic markers. Since randomized controlled trials of R-CHOP in DLBCL have included select subgroups of patients, the utility of the International Prognostic Index (IPI) has not been reassessed. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP in the province of British Columbia to assess the value of the IPI in the era of immunochemotherapy. The IPI remains predictive, but it identifies only 2 risk groups. Redistribution of the IPI factors into a revised IPI (R-IPI) provides a more clinically useful prediction of outcome. The R-IPI identifies 3 distinct prognostic groups with a very good (4-year progression-free survival [PFS] 94\%, overall survival [OS] 94\%), good (4-year PFS 80\%, OS 79\%), and poor (4-year PFS 53\%, OS 55\%) outcome, respectively (P {$<$} .001). The IPI (or R-IPI) no longer identifies a risk group with less than a 50\% chance of survival. In the era of R-CHOP treatment, the R-IPI is a clinically useful prognostic index that may help guide treatment planning and interpretation of clinical trials.},

AIM: Evaluation of mortality risk factors in chronic pancreatitis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Eighty-two patients with chronic pancreatitis were followed-up for an average period of 25 months (median 25 months). None of them had an endoscopic treatment before inclusion in this study. The average age of the patients was 48 years (range 29 to 78, median 49), the ratio men:women being 6.5:1. The etiology was alcoholic in 84.2 \% cases, pancreas divisum in 8.5\% cases and idiopathic in 7.3\% of cases. RESULTS: During the follow-up period the mortality rate was 17\%, death occurring at on average 59 months (median 53 months) from the onset of the disease. The most frequent causes of death were: pancreatic cancer (3.6\%), complications after surgery (3.6\%) and upper digestive hemorrhage (2.4\%). The mortality risk factors were presence of diabetes, no alleviation of pain under treatment and unceasing of smoking. The type of treatment applied did not influence survival. The cumulative survival rate estimated at 3 years was 80\% and at 5 years 59\%. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in chronic pancreatitis was higher than those reported in the literature. Death caused by pancreatic cancer occurred in 3.6 \% of the patients. There were no cases of death due to extra pancreatic cancers. The mortality risk factors were unceasing of smoking, no alleviation of pain under treatment and presence of diabetes.},

  abstract = {Background: Several studies have documented an association between socioeconomic position and survival from gynaecological cancer, but the mechanisms are unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association between level of education and survival after endometrial cancer among Danish women; and whether differences in stage at diagnosis and comorbidity contribute to the educational differences in survival. Methods: Women with endometrial cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 were identified in the Danish Gynaecological Cancer Database, with information on clinical characteristics, surgery, body mass index (BMI) and smoking status. Information on highest attained education, cohabitation and comorbidity was obtained from nationwide administrative registries. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between level of education and cancer stage and Cox proportional hazards model for analyses of overall survival. Results: Of the 3638 patients identified during the study period, 787 had died by the end of 2011. The group of patients with short education had a higher odds ratio (OR) for advanced stage at diagnosis, but this was not statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.20; 95\% CI 0.97–1.49). The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for dying of patients with short education was 1.47 (CI 95\% 1.17–1.80). Adjustment for cohabitation status, BMI, smoking and comorbidity did not change HRs, but further adjustment for cancer stage yielded a HR of 1.36 (1.11–1.67). Conclusion: Early detection in all educational groups might reduce social inequalities in survival, however, the unexplained increased risk for death after adjustment for prognostic factors, warrants increased attention to patients with short education in all age groups throughout treatment and rehabilitation.},

The prevalence varies considerably between countries, and between regions within countries. It is estimated that more than half of adults aged 35-65 living in Europe are either overweight or obese. Overweight is more common among men than among women but obesity is more common among women. The prevalence of obesity in Europe is probably in the order of 10-20\% in men and 15-25\% in adult women. In most European countries who have reliable data on time-trends the prevalence of obesity seems to be increasing. In most European countries, obesity is usually inversely associated with socio-economic status, particularly among women. New classifications of overweight may be based on cut-off points for simple anthropometric measures which reflects both total adiposity as well as abdominal fatness.},

We performed a retrospective analysis of ALS-associated death rates and trends in the United States for 1979-2001 using death records from the national multiple cause-of-death database. The US average annual age-adjusted ALS death rate was 1.84 per 100,000 persons for 1979 through 1998. Most deaths were among adults {$>$} or =65 years of age and the median age at death was 67 years. A small overall increase in the death rate was observed primarily between 1979 and 1983, with a subsequent plateau. This slight change in the overall rate reflected apparent increases in the rates among those persons {$>$} or =65 years of age, particularly women, and persons in the 20- to 49-year-old age group. The ALS-associated death rate appeared to differ by geographic area, with a higher occurrence among most northern states. Our findings suggest that the epidemiology of ALS-associated deaths in the United States demonstrated small increases in the overall age-adjusted death rate and in the death rates among elderly women and adults 20-49 years of age. Subpopulations at higher risk for ALS were males, whites, persons {$>$} or =65 years of age, and residents of northern states. This study provides information for further studies to examine the epidemiology and risk factors associated with ALS.},

  abstract = {Background and objective Diagnostic models used in the management of suspected angina provide no explicit information about prognosis. We present a new prognostic model of 10-year coronary mortality in patients presenting for the first time with suspected angina to complement the Diamond-Forrester diagnostic model of disease probability. Methods and results A multicentre cohort of 8762 patients with suspected angina was followed up for a median of 10 years during which 233 coronary deaths were observed. Developmental (n=4412) and validation (n=4350) prognostic models based on clinical data available at first presentation showed good performance with close agreement and the final model utilised all 8762 patients to maximise power. The prognostic model showed strong associations with coronary mortality for age, sex, chest pain typicality, smoking status, diabetes, pulse rate, and ECG findings. Model discrimination was good (C statistic 0.83), patients in the highest risk quarter accounting for 173 coronary deaths (10-year risk of death: 8.7\%) compared with a total of 60 deaths in the three lower risk quarters. When the model was simplified to incorporate only Diamond-Forrester factors (age, sex and character of symptoms) it underestimated coronary mortality risk, particularly in patients with reversible risk factors. Conclusions For the first time in patients with suspected angina, a prognostic model is presented based on simple clinical factors available at the initial cardiological assessment. The model discriminated powerfully between patients at high risk and lower risk of coronary death during 10-year follow-up. Clinical utility was reflected in the prognostic value it added to the updated Diamond-Forrester diagnostic model of disease probability.},

We compared the long term transplant free survival of alcoholic (AC) and cryptogenic (CC) cirrhosis patients in a setting where liver transplantation was, until very recently, not available. AC and CC patient details were extracted from our database, maintained since 1995. For those who had not attended clinics within the past 4 weeks, the patient or families were contacted to obtain survival status. If deceased, cause of death was ascertained from death certificates and patient records. Survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results Complete details were available in 549/651 (84.3\%) patients (AC 306, CC 243). Mean follow up duration (SD) (months) was 29.9 (32.6). 82/96 deaths (85.4\%) among AC and 80/94 deaths (85.1\%) among CC were liver related. Multivariate analysis showed age at diagnosis and Child’s class predicted overall survival among all groups. The median survival in Child’s class B and C were 53.5 and 25.3 months respectively. Survival was similar among AC and CC. Among AC survival was improved by abstinence [HR = 0.63 (95\% CI: 0.40-1.00)] and was worse with diabetes [HR=1.59 (95\% CI: 1.02- 2.48)] irrespective of alcohol status. Conclusions The overall survival of AC was similar to CC. Death in both groups were predominantly liver related, and was predicated by age at diagnosis and Child class. Among AC, presence of diabetes and non-abstinence from alcohol were independent predictors for poor survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population studies suggest that high body mass index (BMI) correlates with a reduced risk for death from lung cancer. The aim of our study was to evaluate definitively the influence of BMI on long-term overall survival (OS) in surgical patients with NSCLC. METHODS: The study population consisted of 1935 patients who underwent surgical resection for lung cancer at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (2000-2014). Study variables included both patient- and treatment-related characteristics. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with OS. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, significant predictors of improved survival were higher BMI, pathologic tumor stage (stage I versus stage II, III, or IV), type of surgical procedure (lobectomy/pneumonectomy versus wedge resection/segmentectomy),~younger age, female sex, and adenocarcinoma histologic subtype (versus squamous) (all p {$<$} 0.05). Morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥ 35) demonstrated a trend toward better outcomes than those classified as obese (BMI ≥30 and {$<$}35 kg/m(2)) (p~= 0.05), overweight (BMI ≥ 25 and {$<$}30 kg/m(2)) (p~= 0.13), or healthy weight (BMI {$<$}25 kg/m(2)) (p~= 0.37) (hazard ratio~= 0.727, 0.848, 0.926, and 1, respectively). On multivariate analysis, BMI remained an independent predictor of survival (p~= 0.02). Propensity matching analysis demonstrated significantly better OS (p~=~0.003) in patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or higher as compared with a BMI of 25 kg/m(2). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, retrospective, single-center series, after control for disease stage and other variables, higher BMI was associated with improved OS after surgical resection of NSCLC. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the precise relationship between BMI and treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objectives We sought to assess the relationship between increasing use of cardiovascular medications and trends in long-term prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI) in the elderly. Background During the past decade, statins, beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been increasingly used after MI. However, little is known about the relationship between increasing use of these medications and improvements in prognosis after MI. Methods Using data from pharmacy assistance programs and Medicare in 2 states (1995 to 2004), we identified patients with MI who survived ≥30 days after discharge. We assessed age, gender, race, comorbidities, and coronary interventions during the MI hospitalization and recorded filled prescriptions for statins, BBs, ACEIs/ARBs, or antiplatelet agents within 30 days after discharge. All patients were tracked until they died or until the end of the eligibility/study period. We built multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess trends in long-term mortality and the contribution to increasing medication use after MI. Results Of 21,484 patients identified, 12,142 died during 74,982 person-years of follow-up. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, we found that mortality after MI decreased significantly from 1995 to 2004 (hazard ratio for annual trend 0.97; 95\% confidence interval 0.97 to 0.98), a 3\% reduction in mortality each year. Adjusting for the use of statins, BBs, ACEIs/ARBs, and antiplatelet drugs after discharge completely eliminated the association between time trend and mortality (hazard ratio 1.00; 95\% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.01). Conclusions The observed improvement in long-term mortality in elderly patients with MI may be mainly due to increased use of cardiovascular medications after discharge.},

The magnitude of the decrease in risk associated with smoking cessation after MI has not been well described in patients with LV dysfunction after MI. We aimed to quantify the risk decrease associated with smoking cessation in subjects with LV dysfunction after MI. The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial randomized 2,231 subjects with LV dysfunction 3 to 16 days after MI. Smoking status was assessed at randomization and at regular intervals during a median follow-up of 42 months. Propensity score-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to quantify the decrease in risk of all-cause mortality, death or recurrent MI, and death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization associated with smoking cessation. In baseline smokers who survived to 6 months without interval events, smoking cessation at 6-month follow-up was associated with a significantly lower adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 to 0.91), death or recurrent MI (HR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.47 to 0.99), and death or HF hospitalization (HR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.46 to 0.92). In conclusion, in patients with LV dysfunction after MI, smoking cessation is associated with a 40\% lower hazard of all-cause mortality and a 30\% lower hazard of death or recurrent MI or death or HF hospitalization. These findings indicate that smoking cessation is beneficial after high-risk MI and highlight the importance of smoking cessation as a therapeutic target in patients with LV dysfunction after MI.},

Methods: We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to model variables of 731 consecutive patients treated with radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy for bladder transitional cell carcinoma. Variables included age of patient, gender, pathologic stage (pT), pathologic grade, carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), lymph node status (pN), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACH), adjuvant chemotherapy (ACH), and adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (AXRT). Two hundred bootstrap resamples were used to reduce overfit bias and for internal validation. Results: During a mean follow-up of 36.4 months, 290 of 731 (39.7\%) patients died; 196 of 290 patients (67.6\%) died of bladder cancer. Actuarial all-cause survival estimates were 56.3\% [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 51.8-60.6\%] and 42.9\% (95\% CI, 37.3-48.4\%) at 5 and 8 years after cystectomy, respectively. Actuarial cancer-specific survival estimates were 67.3\% (62.9-71.3\%) and 58.7\% (52.7-64.2\%) at 5 and 8 years, respectively. The accuracy of a nomogram for prediction of all-cause survival (0.732) that included patient age, pT, pN, LVI, NACH, ACH, and AXRT was significantly superior (P = 0.001) to that of AJCC staging–based risk grouping (0.615). Similarly, the accuracy of a nomogram for prediction of cancer-specific survival that included pT, pN, LVI, NACH, and AXRT (0.791) was significantly superior (P = 0.001) to that of AJCC staging–based risk grouping (0.663). Conclusions: Multivariate nomograms provide a more accurate and relevant individualized prediction of survival after cystectomy compared with conventional prediction models, thereby allowing for improved patient counseling and treatment selection.},

Methods: 117 healthy male obese subjects with Body Mass Index 30 kg/m2 and also 110 healthy male non-obese with Body Mass Index of 18.50 – 24.99 kg/m2 were selected. Parameters such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure and pulse blood pressure were assessed. Results: In our study, there was a statistically significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in obese subjects when compared to non-obese in all age group. There was a positive correlation between body mass index and heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure and pulse blood pressure. The degree of rise was higher for the systolic blood pressure than the diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Although our study is by no means exhaustive, it does provides a glimpse into the variety of adaptations in cardiovascular structure and function that occur as excessive adipose tissue accumulates, evenin the absence of overt disease.},

  abstract = {Background Prior studies have observed that smokers have paradoxically favorable 1-year mortality rates after acute coronary syndromes, but it is unknown whether this association extends to long-term outcomes and to older patients. Methods We identified 38,628 patients aged ≥65 years participating in the CRUSADE Registry between February 2003 and December 2006 with non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and linked these patients to Medicare claims data to assess longitudinal outcomes. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between smoking, 30-day, and long-term outcomes. Results Overall, 4,876 (13\%) were current/recent smokers and 33,752 (87\%) were nonsmokers. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers were younger and more likely to be male and to receive in-hospital revascularization (all P {$<$} .001) but less likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency. Compared with nonsmokers, the unadjusted 30-day mortality was lower (8.7\% vs 10.3\%, P = .0004), but the adjusted 30-day mortality was similar (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95\% CI 0.97-1.20). Over a median of 3.6 years of follow-up, smokers had lower crude long-term mortality rates (53\% vs 55\% at 6 years, P = .001) but significantly higher long-term mortality rates after adjustment (adjusted HR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.21-1.34). Smokers also had higher risks of all-cause readmission (HR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.09-1.17) and recurrent myocardial infarction (HR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.13-1.34). Conclusions Among older non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients, we found that smokers had significantly higher long-term risks for both mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction. These results support ongoing efforts to promote smoking cessation, even among older patients.},

Cox regression models were used to identify the clinicopathological factors associated with OSr. By summing scores proportionate to the hazard ratio (HR) for each significant variable, we stratified patients into 3 risk groups., Enrolled patients (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}108) had a median time to recurrence of 15 (range, 3–163) months after initial treatment and a median OSr of 22 (range, 1–207) months. Twenty patients (18.5\%) had locoregional recurrence, and 88 (81.5\%) distant. One hundred three patients underwent salvage therapy; 51 (47.2\%) received chemotherapy only, 22 (20.3\%) received radiotherapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy, and 29 (26.9\%) underwent salvage cytoreductive surgery. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that time to relapse after initial treatment, cancer antigen-125 level at recurrence, and the number of recurrent lesions were independent predictors of OSr. Incorporating these factors, we stratified patients into low-risk (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}19), intermediate-risk (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}43), and high-risk (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}46) groups.

Clinical signs and manifestations (pruritus, persistent fatigue, jaundice and pain in the right hypochondrium), laboratory parameters (auto-antibodies for autoimmune hepatic disease, biliary and hepatic enzymes, immunoglobulin, bilirubin, and albumin) and imaging findings were recorded at entry and at specific time points during follow-up. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses, respectively, assessed the risk factors for hepatic decompensation and survival., RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-two PBC patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 75.2 mo (range, 21-201 mo). The 240 patients were aged 51.5 ± 10.2 years at diagnosis and 91.6\% were female. Two hundred and forty-five (93.5\%) were seropositive for anti-mitochondrial antibodies. At presentation, 170 patients (64.9\%) were symptomatic, while 96 patients (36.6\%) had extra-hepatic autoimmune disease. During the follow-up period, 62 (23.7\%) patients developed hepatic decompensation of whom four underwent liver transplantation and 17 died. The cumulative survival rate and median survival time were 83.9\% and 181.7 mo, respectively. Cox regression analysis revealed that an incomplete ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) response or inconsistent treatment [P {$<$} 0.001; hazard risk (HR) 95\%CI = 2.423-7.541], anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) positivity (P {$<$} 0.001; HR 95\%CI = 2.516-7.137), alanine aminotransferase ratio (AAR) elevations (P {$<$} 0.001; HR 95\%CI = 1.357-2.678), and histological advanced liver disease (P = 0.006; HR 95\%CI = 1.481-10.847) were predictors of hepatic decompensation. The clinical features and survival of PBC in China are consistent with those described in Western countries., CONCLUSION: Incomplete UDCA response or inconsistent treatment, ACA positivity, AAR elevations, and advanced histological stage are predictors of decompensation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify factors associated with mortality in patients with sarcoidosis listed for lung transplantation, and to create a model for predicting intermediate-term mortality in these individuals. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with sarcoidosis listed for lung transplant in the United States between 1995 and 2000. After identifying important risk factors for death, we developed a mortality prediction model based on an inception cohort of 75\% of the subjects. The remaining 25\% of the individuals served as a validation cohort for determining the validity of the model. SETTING AND PATIENTS: All patients with sarcoidosis in the United States irrespective of referral center listed for lung transplantation between 1995 and 2000. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Adequate follow-up data were available for 405 patients, and 111 patients (27.4\%) died while awaiting lung transplantation. Neither patient age nor gender correlated with mortality. Survivors and nonsurvivors did not differ based on the results of spirometric testing. African Americans faced a significantly increased risk of death, which persisted after controlling for other confounders (odds ratio, 2.5). The amount of supplemental oxygen used and the mean pulmonary artery pressure were the only other variables predictive of mortality. The mean (+/- SD) pulmonary artery pressure in those who survived was 31.7 +/- 11.5 mm Hg, compared to 41.4 +/- 14.4 mm Hg in nonsurvivors (p {$<$} 0.01). Survivors required 2.2 +/- 2.0 L/min of oxygen vs 2.9 +/- 1.7 L/min in those who died awaiting transplant (p {$<$} 0.01). Differences in pulmonary artery pressures did not reflect differences in cardiac status, as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and the cardiac index were similar in survivors and nonsurvivors. The final mortality prediction model included three variables: race, amount of supplemental oxygen needed, and mean pulmonary artery pressure. Based on the validation cohort, the concordance of the model for death within 2 years of listing was 0.61 (95\% confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.76), indicating only moderate explanatory power. CONCLUSIONS: Race, pulmonary hypertension, and oxygen use are important factors indicative of mortality in this population. Specific guidelines for determining time of referral for transplantation in advanced sarcoidosis should be developed. Recommendations extrapolated from data for other types of interstitial lung disease may not be applicable in sarcoidosis. The independent effect of race on outcome is troubling.},

Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (KPNC), a comprehensive prepaid integrated health-care system. Case patients (n = 45,966) were all KPNC members with COPD who were identified during a 4-year period from January 1996 through December 1999. An equal number of control subjects without COPD were selected from KPNC membership and were matched for gender, year of birth, and length of KPNC membership. Follow-up conducted for hospitalization and mortality from CVD end points through December 31, 2000. CVD study end points included cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, pulmonary embolism, all of the aforementioned study end points combined, other CVD, and all CVD end points. The mean follow-up time was 2.75 years for case patients and 2.99 years for control subjects. The risk of hospitalization was higher in COPD case patients than in control subjects for all CVD hospitalization and mortality end points. The relative risk (RR) for hospitalization for the composite measure of all study end points was 2.09 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.99 to 2.20) after adjustment for gender, preexisting CVD study end points, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, and ranged from 1.33 (stroke) to 3.75 (CHF). The adjusted RR for mortality for the composite measure of all study end points was 1.68 (95\% CI, 1.50 to 1.88), ranging from 1.25 (stroke) to 3.53 (CHF). Younger patients (ie, age {$<$} 65 years) and female patients had higher risks than older and male participants. COPD was a predictor of CVD hospitalization and mortality over an average follow-up time of nearly 3 years. The finding of a stronger relationship of COPD to CVD outcomes in patients {$<$} 65 years of age suggests that CVD risk should be monitored and treated with particular care in younger adults with COPD.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. This article provides an overview of colorectal cancer statistics, including the most current data on incidence, survival, and mortality rates and trends. Incidence data were provided by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2014, an estimated 71,830 men and 65,000 women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 26,270 men and 24,040 women will die of the disease. Greater than one-third of all deaths (29\% in men and 43\% in women) will occur in individuals aged 80 years and older. There is substantial variation in tumor location by age. For example, 26\% of colorectal cancers in women aged younger than 50 years occur in the proximal colon, compared with 56\% of cases in women aged 80 years and older. Incidence and death rates are highest in blacks and lowest in Asians/Pacific Islanders; among males during 2006 through 2010, death rates in blacks (29.4 per 100,000 population) were more than double those in Asians/Pacific Islanders (13.1) and 50\% higher than those in non-Hispanic whites (19.2). Overall, incidence rates decreased by approximately 3\% per year during the past decade (2001–2010). Notably, the largest drops occurred in adults aged 65 and older. For instance, rates for tumors located in the distal colon decreased by more than 5\% per year. In contrast, rates increased during this time period among adults younger than 50 years. Colorectal cancer death rates declined by approximately 2\% per year during the 1990s and by approximately 3\% per year during the past decade. Progress in reducing colorectal cancer death rates can be accelerated by improving access to and use of screening and standard treatment in all populations.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between long-term prognosis and risk factors in different clinical categories of CHD. METHODS: A general population sample of 9141 men, aged 34-79 at entry into the study was divided into six groups with respect to manifestations of CHD at entry: I. Symptomatic infarction. II. Silent or unrecognized infarction. III. Angina pectoris with ischaemic changes on ECG. IV. Angina without ischaemic changes. V. Angina by Rose questionnaire but not confirmed by a physician. VI. No manifestations of CHD. RESULTS: The risk factor profile varied considerably between the different categories and by life-table analysis marked differences in survival were demonstrated between the groups. The risk factors maintained their detrimental effects on prognosis in the presence of CHD. Thus, age, serum total cholesterol, impaired glucose tolerance and smoking were found by Cox's regression to be statistically significant independent risk factors of CHD mortality among men having manifestations of CHD (groups I-V). Furthermore, the composite risk score, a measure of the overall risk factor exposures had marked effect on the prognosis of the various CHD groups. When the comprehensive risk factor score for both CHD mortality and all-cause mortality was accounted for marked differences persisted in the long-term prognosis. Compared to those without CHD the infarct groups had about a 7.6- and 3.7-fold risk of dying from CHD and all causes respectively. Those with angina had from 2.5- to 3.2-fold risk of CHD mortality and 1.7- to 2.2-fold risk of all-cause mortality depending on the subgroup of angina, again compared to those without manifestations of CHD. CONCLUSION: Different categories of CHD had different risk factor profiles and the long-term prognosis resulted from a complex interplay between those factors and the diagnostic category of CHD. The risk factors maintained their detrimental effects on prognosis in the presence of CHD and after accounting for the comprehensive risk factor score marked differences persisted in the long-term prognosis, being worst for those having suffered a myocardial infarction, either symptomatic or silent.},

Methods The LDCT of 2303 screenees were retrospectively reviewed with the specific aim of describing the prevalence and features of pleural plaques. Self-administered questionnaire was used to assess asbestos exposure. Frequency of lung cancer, lung cancer mortality, and overall mortality were detailed according to presence of pleural findings. Statistical analyses included comparison of mean or median, contingency tables, and Cox model for calculation of hazard ratio (HR) and its 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results Among male screenees, 31/1570 (2\%) showed pleural abnormalities, 128/1570 (8.2\%) disclosed asbestos exposure, 23/31 (74.2\%) subjects with pleural plaques consistently denied exposure to asbestos. There was a trend for higher frequency of lung cancer among subjects with pleural plaques (9.7\% vs 4.2\%). Lung cancer in subjects with pleural plaques was always diagnosed in advanced stage. Subjects with pleural plaques showed HR 5.48 (95\% CI 1.61–18.70) for mortality from lung cancer. Conclusions Pleural plaques are a risk factor for lung cancer mortality that can be detected in lung cancer screening by LDCT, also in subjects that are not aware of asbestos exposure.

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Little is known about differences in rates of fibrosis progression between patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) vs nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies that assessed paired liver biopsy specimens to estimate the rates of fibrosis progression in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) including NAFL and NASH. Methods Through a systematic search of multiple databases and author contact, up to June 2013, we identified studies of adults with NAFLD that collected paired liver biopsy specimens at least 1~year apart. From these, we calculated a pooled-weighted annual fibrosis progression rate (number of stages changed between the 2 biopsy samples) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), and identified clinical risk factors associated with progression. Results We identified 11 cohort studies including 411 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (150 with NAFL and 261 with NASH). At baseline, the distribution of fibrosis for stages 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 35.8\%, 32.5\%, 16.7\%, 9.3\%, and 5.7\%, respectively. Over 2145.5 person-years of follow-up evaluation, 33.6\% had fibrosis progression, 43.1\% had stable fibrosis, and 22.3\% had an improvement in fibrosis stage. The annual fibrosis progression rate in patients with NAFL who had stage 0 fibrosis at baseline was 0.07 stages (95\% CI, 0.02–0.11 stages), compared with 0.14 stages in patients with NASH (95\% CI, 0.07–0.21 stages). These findings correspond to 1 stage of progression over 14.3 years for patients with NAFL (95\% CI, 9.1–50.0 y) and 7.1 years for patients with NASH (95\% CI, 4.8–14.3 y). Conclusions Based on a meta-analysis of studies of paired liver biopsy studies, liver fibrosis progresses in patients with NAFL and NASH.},

The main objective was to compare outcomes in those with HbA1c ≥ and {$<$}7\% (53 mmol/mol). Methods: Individuals with type 2 diabetes from Aarhus County, Denmark, were identified from public data files in a 3 year period (2001-2003). Stratifying the 17,760 individuals by HbA1c, we estimated HRs for diabetes-related morbidities and all-cause mortality using Cox regression. Results were also stratified by treatment modality. Results: In total, 1,805 individuals experienced at least one diabetes-related morbidity and 1,859 individuals died. In general, the HRs in adjusted analyses of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality were increased for HbA1c ≥ 7\% (53 mmol/mol): morbidity, HR 1.48 (95\% CI 1.34, 1.63); and mortality, HR 1.26 (95\% CI 1.15, 1.39). On grouping individuals according to HbA1c {$<$}5\% (31 mmol/mol), 5.0-5.9\% (31-41 mmol/mol), 6.0-6.9\% (42-52 mmol/mol), 7.0-7.9\% (53-63 mmol/mol), 8.0-8.9\% (64-74 mmol/mol) and ≥9\% (75 mmol/mol), the HRs for mortality formed a U shape, with HbA 1c 6.0-6.9\% (42-52 mmol/mol) at the lowest point. For diabetes-related morbidity, a dose-response pattern appeared (lowest for HbA1c {$<$} 5\% [31 mmol/mol]). Patterns of HR differed with treatment modality. Conclusions/interpretation: An HbA1c level ≥7\% (53 mmol/mol) was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Both high and very low levels of HbA1c were associated with increased mortality. A dose-response pattern appeared for morbidity. The impact of HbA1c level on morbidity and mortality depended on treatment modality. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: Thus far, it is unclear whether lifestyle recommendations for people with diabetes should be different from those for the general public. We investigated whether the associations between lifestyle factors and mortality risk differ between individuals with and without diabetes. Methods: Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a cohort was formed of 6,384 persons with diabetes and 258,911 EPIC participants without known diabetes. Joint Cox proportional hazard regression models of people with and without diabetes were built for the following lifestyle factors in relation to overall mortality risk: BMI, waist/height ratio, 26 food groups, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, smoking. Likelihood ratio tests for heterogeneity assessed statistical differences in regression coefficients. Results: Multivariable adjusted mortality risk among individuals with diabetes compared with those without was increased, with an HR of 1.62 (95\% CI 1.51, 1.75). Intake of fruit, legumes, nuts, seeds, pasta, poultry and vegetable oil was related to a lower mortality risk, and intake of butter and margarine was related to an increased mortality risk. These associations were significantly different in magnitude from those in diabetes-free individuals, but directions were similar. No differences between people with and without diabetes were detected for the other lifestyle factors. Conclusions/interpretation: Diabetes status did not substantially influence the associations between lifestyle and mortality risk. People with diabetes may benefit more from a healthy diet, but the directions of association were similar. Thus, our study suggests that lifestyle advice with respect to mortality for patients with diabetes should not differ from recommendations for the general population. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Design Prospective population-based cohort. Setting The UK's Haematological Malignancy Research Network (catchment population 3.6 million, with {$>$}2000 new haematological malignancies diagnosed annually). Participants All patients newly diagnosed with CML, from September 2004 to August 2011 and followed up to 31 March 2013. Main outcome measure Incidence and survival. Results With a median diagnostic age of 59 years, the CML age standardised (European) incidence was 0.9/100 000 (95\% CIs 0.8 to 0.9), 5-year overall survival was 78.9\% (72.3 to 84.0) and 5-year relative survival 88.6\% (81.0 to 93.3). The efficacy of treatment across all ages was clearly demonstrated; the relative survival curves for those under 60 and over 60 years being closely aligned. Survival findings were similar for men and women, but varied with deprivation; the age and sex adjusted HR being 3.43 (1.89 to 6.22) for deprivation categories 4–5 (less affluent) versus 1–3 (more affluent). None of these differences were attributable to the biological features of the disease. Conclusions When therapy is freely provided, population-based survival for CML is similar to that reported in clinical trials, and age loses its prognostic significance. However, although most of the patients with CML now experience close to normal lifespans, those living in more deprived areas tend to have poorer outcomes, despite receiving the same clinical care. A significant improvement in overall population outcomes could be achieved if these socioeconomic differences, which may reflect the treatment compliance, could be eliminated.},

Absolute risk was assessed based on the following risk factors: gender, age, known diabetes, smoking status, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. RESULTS: From the study cohort, 884 were identified as eligible for analysis, 503 (56.9\%) of these were women. The estimated absolute risk (\%) of 5- and 10-year cardiovascular mortality, based on DECODE model, was 1.1±1.3\% and 5.5±6.1\%, respectively; significantly higher absolute risk was estimated in men (1.7±1.6 vs 0.6±0.8, p{$<$}0.001 and 8.9±7.6 vs 2.9±2.5, p{$<$}0.001, for 5- and 10-years absolute risk, respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study is a first assessment of cardiovascular mortality in the Macedonian type 2 diabetic population based on DECODE model. It would be of both clinical and scientific interest to assess the risk prediction accuracy of the model, and to compare it with other diabetes-specific and diabetes non-specific models. AIM: To estimate the absolute risk (\%) of 5- and 10-years cardiovascular mortality in Macedonian type 2 diabetes patients based on DECODE model, and the gender difference of the estimated risk.},

  abstract = {Background—There are limited population-based national data on prognosis in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly on long-term survival and the risk of recurrence. Methods and Results—Record linkage of hospital and mortality data identified 387 452 individuals in England who were admitted to hospital with a main diagnosis of AMI between 2004 and 2010 and who survived for at least 30 days. Seven years after an AMI, the risk of death from any cause in survivors of first or recurrent AMI was, respectively, 2 and 3 times higher than that in the English general population of equivalent age. For all survivors of a first AMI, the risk of a second AMI was highest during the first year and the cumulative risk increased more gradually thereafter. For men, 1- and 7-year cumulative risks were 5.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.5–5.7) and 13.9\% (95\% CI, 13.7–14.1); for women, they were 7.2\% (95\% CI, 7.1–7.4) and 16.2\% (95\% CI, 16.0–16.5). Older age, higher deprivation, no revascularization procedures, and presence of comorbidities were associated with higher recurrence risk. Conclusions—Survivors of both first and recurrent AMI remained at a significantly higher risk of death compared with the general population for at least 7 years after the event. For survivors of first AMI, the influence of predisposing factors for second AMI lessened with time after the initial event. The results reinforce the importance of acute clinical care and secondary prevention in improving long-term prognosis of hospitalized AMI patients.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected patients with type 1 diabetes (n=7,713), and for each of these diabetic subjects five age- and sex-matched control subjects without diabetes (n=38,518) from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Baseline was 1 January 1992; subjects were followed until 1999. The GPRD is a large primary-care database containing morbidity and mortality data of a large sample representative of the UK population. Deaths occurring in the follow-up period were identified. RESULTS: The study comprised 208,178 person-years of follow-up. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes was 2.15/1,000 subjects in 1992 (mean age 33 years, SD 15). Annual mortality rates were 8.0 per 1,000 person-years (95\% CI 7.2-8.9) in type 1 diabetic subjects compared with 2.4 per 1,000 person-years (95\% CI 2.2-2.6) in those without diabetes (hazard ratio [HR]=3.7, 95\% CI 3.2-4.3). The increased mortality rates in patients with type 1 diabetes were apparent across all age-bands. The HR was higher in women (HR=4.5, 95\% CI 3.5-5.6 compared with non-diabetic women) than men (HR=3.3, 95\% CI 2.7-4.0), such that the sex difference (p{$<$}0.0001) in mortality in the non-diabetic population was abolished (p=0.3) in the type 1 diabetic patients. The predominant cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes was cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite advances in care, UK mortality rates in the past decade continue to be much greater in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those without diabetes.},

  abstract = {Background—Studies on long-term mortality following venous thromboembolism (VTE) are sparse. Methods and Results—Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a 30-year nationwide population-based cohort study of 128,223 patients with first-time VTE (1980-2011) and a comparison cohort of 640,760 persons from the general population (without VTE), randomly matched by gender, year of birth, and calendar period. The mortality risks for patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were markedly higher than for the comparison cohort during the first year, and especially within the first 30 days (3.0\% and 31\% vs. 0.4\%). Using Cox regression, we assessed mortality rate ratios (MRRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). The overall 30-year MRR was 1.55 (95\% CI 1.53-1.57) for DVT and 2.77 (2.74-2.81) for PE. The 30-day MRR was 5.38 (5.00-5.80) for DVT and 80.87 (76.02-86.02) for PE. Over time, the 30-day MRR was consistently 5-6-fold increased for DVT, whereas it improved for PE from 138 (125-153) in 1980-1989 to 36.08 (32.65-39.87) in 2000-2011. The 1-10 year and 11-30 year MRRs remained 25\%-40\% increased after both DVT and PE, but were 3-5-fold increased after DVT and 6-11-fold increased after PE when considering VTE as the immediate cause of death. Conclusions—Patients with VTE are at increased risk of dying, especially within the first year after diagnosis, but also during the entire 30-years of follow-up with VTE as an important cause of death. While 30-day mortality after DVT remained fairly constant over the last three decades, it improved markedly for PE.},

  abstract = {Background A number of studies have shown poorer survival among cancer patients with comorbidity. Several mechanisms may underlie this finding. In this review we summarize the current literature on the association between patient comorbidity and cancer prognosis. Prognostic factors examined include tumor biology, diagnosis, treatment, clinical quality, and adherence. Methods All English-language articles published during 2002–2012 on the association between comorbidity and survival among patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer were identified from PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify eligible studies and their main results were then extracted. Results Our search yielded more than 2,500 articles related to comorbidity and cancer, but few investigated the prognostic impact of comorbidity as a primary aim. Most studies found that cancer patients with comorbidity had poorer survival than those without comorbidity, with 5-year mortality hazard ratios ranging from 1.1 to 5.8. Few studies examined the influence of specific chronic conditions. In general, comorbidity does not appear to be associated with more aggressive types of cancer or other differences in tumor biology. Presence of specific severe comorbidities or psychiatric disorders were found to be associated with delayed cancer diagnosis in some studies, while chronic diseases requiring regular medical visits were associated with earlier cancer detection in others. Another finding was that patients with comorbidity do not receive standard cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy as often as patients without comorbidity, and their chance of completing a course of cancer treatment is lower. Postoperative complications and mortality are higher in patients with comorbidity. It is unclear from the literature whether the apparent undertreatment reflects appropriate consideration of greater toxicity risk, poorer clinical quality, patient preferences, or poor adherence among patients with comorbidity. Conclusion Despite increasing recognition of the importance of comorbid illnesses among cancer patients, major challenges remain. Both treatment effectiveness and compliance appear compromised among cancer patients with comorbidity. Data on clinical quality is limited.},

  abstract = {At least one-third of Americans are obese, as defined by body mass indexes corresponding to body weight {$>$} or = 120\% of ideal body weight, and this figure is rising steadily. Women and nonwhites have particularly high rates of obesity. Obesity greatly increases risks for many serious and morbid conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and some cancers. Obesity is clearly associated with increased risk for mortality, but there has been controversy regarding optimal weight with respect to mortality risk. We review the literature concerning obesity and mortality, with reference to body fat distribution and weight gain, and consider potential effects of sex, age, and race on this relation. We conclude that when appropriate adjustments are made for effects of smoking and underlying disease, optimal weights are below average in both men and women; this appears to be true throughout the adult life span. Central obesity, most commonly approximated by the waist-to-hip ratio, may be particularly detrimental, although this requires further study. Weight gain in adulthood is also associated with increased mortality. These observations support public health measures to reduce obesity and weight gain, including recent recommendations to limit weight gain in the adult years to 4.5 kg (10 lb)},

  abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to characterize the prognosis of minimally symptomatic patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Background Recent data have suggested that obstruction may be present in the majority of HCM patients, irrespective of cardiac symptoms. The prognosis of minimally symptomatic obstructive HCM remains poorly defined. Methods We examined 544 consecutive adult patients (age 59 ± 16 years; 55\% men) with obstructive HCM documented by Doppler echocardiography who were free of severe cardiac symptoms, and we performed clinical follow-up (median 9.3 years). Results There was only a slight excess mortality of the cohort in comparison to the expected survival of a similar U.S. general population (10-year observed vs. expected survival, 69.3\% vs. 71.9\%; p = 0.04) and 46\% of the deaths were attributable to noncardiac causes. However, there was a clear relation between increasing severity of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient and outcome. For patients with high resting gradients (Doppler peak velocity {$>$}4 m/s), survival was significantly impaired (53\% at 10 years; p = 0.001 vs. expected), and death or severe symptoms occurred in 68\% of these patients within 10 years after the initial evaluation. Conversely, there was no impairment of long-term survival for patients with less-severe resting obstruction. Independent predictors of mortality in the entire cohort were age, prior stroke, and LVOT gradient severity. Conclusions Patients with obstructive HCM and mild or no symptoms have only slight excess mortality. However, patients with markedly elevated resting LVOT gradients are at a high risk of heart failure and death. These findings may have important implications for therapy, including the timing of septal reduction therapy.},

The U.S. spends far more on health care than any other country. However this high spending cannot be attributed to higher income, an older population, or greater supply or utilization of hospitals and doctors. Instead, the findings suggest the higher spending is more likely due to higher prices and perhaps more readily accessible technology and greater obesity. Health care quality in the U.S. varies and is not notably superior to the far less expensive systems in the other study countries. Of the countries studied, Japan has the lowest health spending, which it achieves primarily through aggressive price regulation.},

Materials and Methods Race/ethnicity, gender, age, staging, length of survival, and cause of death data were analyzed using 39,434 cases of RCC from 1988 to 2004 from the California Cancer Registry. Annual age-adjusted incidence rates and relative survival rates were calculated for the racial/ethnic and gender groups. These rates and the percent of localized cancer were plotted by year, and Microsoft Excel® was used to calculate linear regression equations. Median age was also calculated. Z-tests and X-tests were performed to determine p-values. Results A rise in RCC incidence was found, with localized cancer accounting for most of the increase. Blacks had a significantly higher incidence rate (p{$<$}0.0001) and lower survival rate (p{$<$}0.0001) than all other races/ethnicities, despite having more localized cancer (p{$<$}0.005). Blacks were also diagnosed at a younger age (p{$<$}0.0001) than their counterparts. On the other hand, A/PI’s had a lower incidence rate (p{$<$}0.0001) and higher survival rate (p{$<$}0.05) than all other races/ethnicities. Males had approximately twice the incidence rate of females and a lower survival rate (p{$<$}0.005). Conclusions Higher incidence rates and lower survival rates were identified among Blacks and males when compared to their counterparts, while A/PI’s showed the opposite trends. Such racial/ethnic and gender disparities in RCC incidence and survival may help elucidate biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that can potentially be addressed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have documented an obesity paradox in which overweight and obese people with cardiovascular disease have a better prognosis compared with patients with normal body mass index (BMI). This study sought to quantify the effect of BMI on clinical outcomes after cardiac surgery and investigate the obesity paradox. METHODS: A concurrent cohort study of 2,440 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], valve, or CABG and valve surgery) from January 2004 to December 2008 was carried out. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of BMI: normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9; n=556; 23\%), overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9; n=965; 39\%), and obese (BMI≥30; n=919; 38\%). Multivariable analyses and propensity score matching were used to compare the early and late clinical outcomes among the different BMI groups. RESULTS: Overweight patients had a lower operative mortality (odds ratio, 0.4; 95\% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.9; p=0.031) compared with normal BMI patients. Obese patients had a comparable risk for operative mortality (odds ratio, 0.8; 95\% confidence interval, 0.4 to 1.6; p=0.47) compared with normal-weight patients. Actuarial 5-year survival was better for the overweight (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95\% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.8; p=0.002) and comparable for the obese (hazard ratio, 0.9; 95\% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.4; p=0.49) groups compared with the normal-weight patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight patients have better early hospital outcomes and improved survival after cardiac surgery compared with normal BMI patients, supporting the obesity paradox.},

Data on the role of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in survival are sparse except for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods We studied mortality of 3,581 patients in an academic clinic from 1993 to 2004. Average follow-up was 4.1 years. We studied patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (n = 174), possible AD (n = 206), probable AD (n = 1,175), Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 661), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 357), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (n = 94), Lewy body disease (LBD) (n = 64), and controls (n = 850). We compared patients’ mortality to the US population and to controls. Results Mortality ranged from 7\% for controls to 58\% for ALS patients. The median survival times from initial visit for PD, FTD, probable AD, possible AD, LBD, and ALS were 8.9, 7.0, 5.9, 5.6, 5.3, and 2.7 years, respectively.

A lower initial MMSE score was associated with higher mortality for probable AD, PD, and MCI, while APOE4 predicted mortality for PD and LBD. Non-whites had 20\% lower mortality rates than whites for all dementias combined, adjusting for education. Conclusions All neurologic diseases, including MCI, had increased mortality versus controls.

  abstract = {Purpose: Recommendations for adjuvant treatment for women with early-stage endometrial carcinoma (EC) are based on clinicopathological features. Comprehensive genomic characterisation defined four subgroups: p53-mutant, microsatellite instability (MSI), POLE-mutant and no specific molecular profile (NSMP). We aimed to confirm the prognostic capacity of these subgroups in large randomised trial populations, investigate potential other prognostic classifiers, and integrate these into an integrated molecular risk assessment guiding adjuvant therapy. Experimental design: Analysis of MSI, hotspot mutations in 14 genes including POLE, protein expression of p53, ARID1a, β-catenin, L1CAM, PTEN, ER, and PR was undertaken on 947 available early-stage endometrioid ECs from the PORTEC-1 and -2 trials, mostly high-intermediate risk (n=614). Prognostic value was determined using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Areas under the curve of different risk stratification models were compared. Results: Molecular analyses were feasible in {$>$}96\% of the patients and confirmed the four molecular subgroups: p53-mutant (9\%), MSI (26\%), POLE-mutant (6\%), and NSMP (59\%). Integration of prognostic molecular alterations with established clinicopathological factors resulted in a stronger model with improved risk prognostication. Approximately 15\% of high-intermediate risk patients had unfavourable features (substantial LVSI, p53-mutant, and/or {$>$}10\% L1CAM), 50\% favourable features (POLE-mutant, NSMP being microsatellite stable and CTNNB1-wild type), and 35\% intermediate features (MSI or CTNNB1-mutant). Conclusions: Integrating clinicopathological and molecular factors improves the risk assessment of patients with early-stage EC. Assessment of this integrated risk profile is feasible in daily practice, and holds promise to reduce both over- and undertreatment.},

Persistent inflammation commonly features in clinical conditions where the obesity paradox is described. We examined the relationship between BMI and mortality in HD patients, accounting for inflammation, in a historic cohort study of 5904 incident HD patients enrolled in 2007–2009 (312 facilities; 15 European countries) with ≥3 months of follow-up. Patients were classified by presence (n=3231) or absence (n=2673) of inflammation (C-reactive protein ≥10 mg/l and/or albumin ≤35 g/l). Patients were divided into quintiles by BMI (Q1–Q5: {$<$}21.5, 21.5–24.0, {$>$}24.0–26.4, {$>$}26.4–29.8, and {$>$}29.8 kg/m2, respectively). Noninflamed patients in BMI Q5 formed the reference group. During a median follow-up period of 36.7 months, 1929 deaths occurred (822 cardiovascular), with 655 patients censored for renal transplantation and 1183 for loss to follow-up. Greater mortality was observed in inflamed patients (P{$<$}0.001). In fully adjusted time-dependent analyses, the all-cause mortality risk in noninflamed patients was higher only in the lowest BMI quintile (hazard ratio [HR, 1.80; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.26 to 2.56). No protective effect was associated with higher BMI quintiles in noninflamed patients. Conversely, higher BMI associated with lower all-cause mortality risk in inflamed patients (HR [95\% CI] for Q1: 5.63 [4.25 to 7.46]; Q2: 3.88 [2.91 to 5.17]; Q3: 2.89 [2.16 to 3.89]; Q4: 2.14 [1.59 to 2.90]; and Q5: 1.77 [1.30 to 2.40]).

  abstract = {Objective Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the overall and liver-related mortality and their predictors in patients with CLD using population data. Methods The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and linked mortality data were utilised. Participants from NHANES III (1988–1994) and their mortality status were updated by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) as of 31 December 2006. In this study, the aetiology of CLD was based on available serological tests and clinical data. Each diagnostic cohort was compared with a cohort without liver disease using stratum-specific χ2. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for analysis, and HRs adjusted for all major confounders; overall mortality and cause-specific mortality were calculated for each type of liver disease. All analyses were run using SAS-callable SUDAAN 10.0 functions using remote access to the CDC Research Data Center server with restricted use linked mortality data. Results The study cohort included 15 866 NHANES III participants with complete clinical, demographic, laboratory and mortality follow-up data. Of these, 235 subjects had alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), 66 had chronic hepatitis B (CH-B), 264 had chronic hepatitis C (CH-C), 991 were presumed to have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 505 had other liver disease. Additionally, 13 004 subjects without evidence of liver disease served as controls. The analysis shows that type II diabetes (DM) and/or insulin resistance (IR) are independent predictors of overall mortality in CH-B, NAFLD and ALD (p {$<$}0.05). Additionally, DM, IR, obesity and metabolic syndrome could be independent predictors of liver-related mortality in CH-C, NAFLD and ALD. Conclusions Components of metabolic syndrome are associated with overall and liver-related mortality in subjects with CLD.},

The aim of this study was to assess all-cause and liver-specific mortality in a cohort of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.MethodsBiopsy-proven NAFLD patients with and without NASH from two historic databases were included. Clinico-demographic information from the time of biopsy was available. Mortality data were obtained from National Death Index-Plus and used for estimating overall and cause-specific mortality. The non-parametric Kaplan–Meier method with log-rank test and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazard model were used to compare cohorts.ResultsTwo hundred eighty-nine NAFLD patients were included (50.3 ± 14.5 years old, 39.4 \% male, 78.6 \% Caucasian, 46.0 \% obese, 26.0 \% diabetic, 5.9 \% with family history of liver diseases). Of these, 59.2 \% had NASH whereas 40.8 \% had non-NASH NAFLD. NASH patients were predominantly female, had higher aspartate aminotranserase, alanine aminotransferase and fasting serum glucose. During follow-up (median 150 months, maximum 342 months), patients with NASH had higher probability of mortality from liver-related causes than non-NASH NAFLD patients (p value = 0.0026). In the entire NAFLD cohort, older age [aHR = 1.07 (95 \% CI = 1.05–1.10)] and presence of type II diabetes [aHR = 2.09 (1.39–3.14)] were independent predictors of overall mortality. However, in addition to age [aHR = 1.06 (1.02–1.10)] having histologic NASH [aHR = 9.16 (2.10–9.88)] was found to be an independent predictor of liver-related mortality. Additionally, presence of type II diabetes was associated with liver-related mortality [aHR = 2.19 (1.00–4.81)].ConclusionsThis long-term follow-up of NAFLD patients confirms that NASH patients have higher risk of liver-related mortality than non-NASH. Additionally, patients with NAFLD and type II diabetes are at highest risk for overall and liver-related mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although increases in obesity over the past 30 years have adversely affected the health of the U.S. population, there have been concomitant improvements in health because of reductions in smoking. Having a better understanding of the joint effects of these trends on longevity and quality of life will facilitate more efficient targeting of health care resources. METHODS: For each year from 2005 through 2020, we forecasted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy for a representative 18-year-old, assuming a continuation of past trends in smoking (based on data from the National Health Interview Survey for 1978 through 1979, 1990 through 1991, 1999 through 2001, and 2004 through 2006) and past trends in body-mass index (BMI) (based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 1971 through 1975, 1988 through 1994, 1999 through 2002, and 2003 through 2006). The 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was used to examine the effects of smoking and BMI on health-related quality of life. RESULTS: The negative effects of increasing BMI overwhelmed the positive effects of declines in smoking in multiple scenarios. In the base case, increases in the remaining life expectancy of a typical 18-year-old are held back by 0.71 years or 0.91 quality-adjusted years between 2005 and 2020. If all U.S. adults became nonsmokers of normal weight by 2020, we forecast that the life expectancy of an 18-year-old would increase by 3.76 life-years or 5.16 quality-adjusted years. CONCLUSIONS: If past obesity trends continue unchecked, the negative effects on the health of the U.S. population will increasingly outweigh the positive effects gained from declining smoking rates. Failure to address continued increases in obesity could result in an erosion of the pattern of steady gains in health observed since early in the 20th century},

Subjects and methods The Renfrew/Paisley Study surveyed 7052 men and 8354 women aged 45–64 years between 1972 and 1976. All hospitalizations and deaths occurring during the subsequent 20 years were analyzed by the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation at baseline. Lone atrial fibrillation was defined in the absence of other cardiovascular signs or symptoms. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for age and cardiovascular conditions. Results After 20 years, 42 (89\%) of the 47 women with atrial fibrillation had a cardiovascular event (death or hospitalization), compared with 2276 (27\%) of the 8307 women without this arrhythmia. Among men, 35 (66\%) of 53 with atrial fibrillation had an event, compared with 3151 (45\%) of 6999 without atrial fibrillation. In women, atrial fibrillation was an independent predictor of cardiovascular events (rate ratio [RR] = 3.0; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1–4.2), fatal or nonfatal strokes (RR = 3.2; 95\% CI: 1.0–5.0), and heart failure (RR = 3.4; 95\% CI: 1.9–6.2). The rate ratios among men were 1.8 (95\% CI: 1.3–2.5) for cardiovascular events, 2.5 (95\% CI: 1.3–4.8) for strokes, and 3.4 (95\% CI: 1.7–6.8) for heart failure. Atrial fibrillation was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in women (RR = 2.2; 95\% CI: 1.5–3.2) and men (RR = 1.5; 95\% CI: 1.2–2.2). However, lone atrial fibrillation (which occurred in 15 subjects) was not associated with a statistically significant increase in either cardiovascular events (RR = 1.5; 95\% CI: 0.6–3.6) or mortality (RR = 1.8; 95\% CI: 0.9–3.8). Conclusion Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased long-term risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, especially in women.},

Both cuffs showed a significant overestimation of the diastolic blood pressure (standard cuff 13 mm Hg, P {$<$} .001, Tricuff 6 mm Hg, P {$<$} .01). The error of the standard cuff was significantly greater than that of the Tricuff (P {$<$} .001). The differences in systolic blood pressure between the intraarterially and the indirectly measured results were small (0.2 to 3 mm Hg) and not statistically significant with either cuff. The new Tricuff offered an advantage as compared to a large standard cuff in terms of a lesser overestimation of the diastolic blood pressure. In practical terms, this should lead to a reduction in the overestimation of diastolic hypertension in obese individuals},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated Multidimensional Geriatric Assessment (MGA) as predictor of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). BACKGROUND: Currently used global risk scores do not reliably estimate mortality and MACCE in these patients. METHODS: This prospective cohort comprised 100 consecutive patients ≥ 70 years undergoing TAVI. Global risk scores (Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] score, EuroSCORE) and MGA-based scores (cognition, nutrition, mobility, activities of daily living [ADL], and frailty index) were evaluated as predictors of all-cause mortality and MACCE 30 days and 1 year after TAVI in regression models. RESULTS: In univariable analyses, all predictors were significantly associated with mortality and MACCE at 30 days and 1 year, except for the EuroSCORE at 30 days and instrumental ADL at 30 days and 1 year. Associations of cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR]: 2.98, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 8.31), malnutrition (OR: 6.72, 95\% CI: 2.04 to 22.17), mobility impairment (OR: 6.65, 95\% CI: 2.15 to 20.52), limitations in basic ADL (OR: 3.63, 95\% CI: 1.29 to 10.23), and frailty index (OR: 3.68, 95\% CI: 1.21 to 11.19) with 1-year mortality were similar compared with STS score (OR: 5.47, 95\% CI: 1.48 to 20.22) and EuroSCORE (OR: 4.02, 95\% CI: 0.86 to 18.70). Similar results were found for 30-day mortality and MACCE. Bivariable analyses, including STS score or EuroSCORE suggested independent associations of MGA-based scores (e.g., OR of frailty index: 3.29, 95\% CI: 1.06 to 10.15, for 1-year mortality in a model including EuroSCORE). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that risk prediction can be improved by adding MGA-based information to global risk scores. Larger studies are needed for the development and validation of improved risk prediction models.},

  abstract = {Introduction Recent developments in the care of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have the potential to improve survival rates. Population-based estimates of the current disease burden are needed to evaluate the future impact of newly approved therapies. The objective of this study is to describe incidence, prevalence, and survival of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients in the UK. Methods Between 2000 and 2012, a patient cohort (N\,=\,9,748,108), identified from Clinical Practice Research Datalink primary care data, was used to identify incident and prevalent cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis–clinical syndrome. Incident cases were followed up to identify deaths. Poisson and Cox regressions were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and hazard ratios for mortality, respectively. Adjustments were made for age, gender, and strategic health authority. Survival from diagnosis was estimated using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Results In total 1491 and 4527 incident cases were identified using narrow and broad idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis–clinical syndrome definitions, respectively. Incidence and prevalence increased during the study. Compared with 2000, a near 80\% increase in incidence was observed by 2012 [IRR 1.78 (95\% CI 1.50–2.11; broad definition)], despite an observed decrease using the narrow definition [0.50 (0.38–0.65)]. Median survival was 3.0~years (95\% CI 2.8–3.1) and 2.7~years (95\% CI 2.5–3.0) in broad (n\,=\,2168) and narrow case sets (n\,=\,996), respectively. No significant changes in survival were observed. Conclusions Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis incidence rates have increased since 2000 and survival remains poor. These results provide a benchmark against which the effects of future treatment changes can be measured. Funding InterMune UK and Ireland (now part of F. Hoffman La Roche).

We aimed to develop and validate a 10-year mortality prediction model for older adults using data from developed and developing countries. Methods: We used data from five cohorts, including data from 16 developed and developing countries: ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Aging), HRS (Health and Retirement Study), MHAS (Mexican Health and Aging Study), SABE-Sao Paulo (The Health, Well-being and Aging), and SHARE (Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe). 35,367 older adults were split into training (two thirds) and test (one third) data sets. Baseline predictors included age, sex, comorbidities, and functional and cognitive measures. We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis using a sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with time to death as the time scale. We validated the model using Harrell's C statistic (discrimination) and the estimated slope between observed and predicted 10-year mortality risk across deciles of risk (calibration). Results: During a median of 8.6 years, 8,325 participants died. The final model included age, sex, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, physical activity, self-reported health, difficulty with bathing, walking several blocks, and reporting date correctly. The model showed good discrimination (Harrell's C = 0.76) and calibration (slope = 1.005). Models for developed versus developing country cohorts performed equally well when applied to data from developing countries. Conclusion: A parsimonious mortality prediction model using data from multiple cohorts in developed and developing countries can be used to predict mortality in older adults in both settings.},

RESULTS: Survival at 1 year differed dramatically between the population-based cohort and the referral case series at 1 year (95\% compared with 69\%, respectively) and at 5 years (80\% compared with 36\%, respectively) (P less than 0.001). Long-term survival for the population-based cohort was nonetheless impaired when compared with an age- and sex-matched cohort, that is, the 1980 Minnesota white population (8-year survival: observed, 58\% compared with expected, 83\%; P less than 0.001). Among community patients, older age (adjusted Cox model hazard ratio for 10-year increase in age, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.08 to 2.35) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (adjusted hazard ratio for 10\% decrease, 1.90; CI, 1.04 to 3.50) were independently associated with impaired survival. CONCLUSIONS: These population-based data challenge the clinical perception of the clinical course of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy based on referral practice prognostic studies and suggest that the clinical course of this condition may be more favorable than previously recognized.},

  abstract = {Background: There is an ongoing debate among researchers about whether the lifespan of successfully treated people living with HIV (PLHIV) is comparable to that of the general population. In this 15 years follow up cohort study we present a survival analysis of People With HIV (PWH) and HIV-negative persons in relation to socio-demographic, virus load, CD-4 count, ART and mortality data from the national Swedish HIV cohort, InfCareHIV. Methods: A total of 4,066 people living with HIV were matched against 8,072 HIV-negative controls according to age, gender, and region of birth. Furthermore the association between viral load and CD-4 level at diagnosis, treatment outcome and mortality was assessed over a 15-year period by Cox regression estimates to compare the overall crude and adjusted Hazard Ratios for mortality. Results: Mortality rates/100 PY, HIV-Positive n=275/4,066 1.13 (1.00-1.27) as compaired to HIV-Negative n=110/8,072, 0.22 (0.18-0.26)p {$<$}0.001. After a 15 year follow up period, successfully treated PLHIV were found to be 3 times more likely to die when compared to HIV-negative controls (HR 3.01, 95\%, CI 2.05-4.44, p{$<$}0.001). The risk of mortality decreased from HR 6.02 after the first year of successful treatment. Only 11 of 58 patients in our cohort died from an AIDS-related condition. When AIDS-attributed mortality is excluded, successfully treated PWH are still 2.4 times more likely to die compared to HIV negative persons (HR 2.43, 95\%, CI 1.61-3.65, p{$<$}0.001). Among the 275 that died, the initial VL was ≥30,000 c/ml among 171 of the patients (62.2\%) and {$<$}30,000 c/ml among 83 of the patients (30.2\%). Patients with VL≥30,000c/mL at HIV diagnosis were associated with a 1.74 (95\% CI 1.34-2.26) greater hazard of death comparedto patients with VL{$<$} 30,000 at diagnosis (p{$<$}0.001). Conclusion: Although effective viral suppression has led to significant increases in longevity and quality of life, ART is not yet able to fully restore life expectancy to a level comparable to that found in HIV-negative persons even when PWH are successfully treated in our Swedish context. If we were used the cut off at ≤ 50/mL the result might have been different. The risk of mortality decreases the longer an HIV patient is able to suppress their VL. Even when PLHIV are successfully treated there are several other important areas related to death, such as smoking and social factors, where data are still missing.}

  abstract = {Objective Acquiring contemporary data on prevalence and natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is essential in the effort to optimise modern screening programmes. The primary aim of this study was to determine the fate of a 65-year-old male population 5 years following an invitation to an aortic ultrasound (US) examination. Methods In this population-based cohort-study, men were invited to US examination at age 65, and were re-invited at age 70. Mortality, AAA repair, and risk factors were recorded. An AAA was defined as a diameter ≥30~mm, and a sub-aneurysmal aorta as 25–29~mm. Results In 2006–2007, 3,268 65-year-old men were invited, and 2,736 (83.7\%) were examined. After 5 years, 24 had completed AAA repair (6 died within 0–4 years), an additional 239 had died, and 194 had moved. Thus, 2,811 70-year-old men were re-invited, and 2,247 (79.9\%) were examined. The AAA prevalence increased from 1.5\% at 65 to 2.4\% (95\% CI: 1.8 to 3.0) at 70, and of sub-aneurysmal aortas from 1.7\% at 65 to 2.6\% (2.0 to 3.3), at 70. Of 2,041 with {$<$}25~mm at 65, 0.7\% had an AAA at 70. Of 40 with a sub-aneurysmal aorta at 65, 52.5\% progressed to AAA at 70. In a Cox regression analysis, sub-aneurysmal aorta at 65 (hazard ratio [HR] 59.78) and smoking (HR 2.78) were independent risk factors for AAA formation. Among 44 with AAA at 65, 22 completed AAA repair with no 30-day mortality. Conclusion AAA screening in a contemporary setting was safe at 5 years, with a single AAA rupture observed among non-attenders. Men with a screening detected AAA had a high repair rate and high non-AAA related mortality. AAA-formation was common among men with sub-aneurysmal dilatation, indicating a possible need for surveillance of this group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in Western populations. There have been few large published cohort studies of people with diabetes that have had more than 10 years of follow-up, and none other than the present one are in the UK. Such studies are important to understand the long-term fatal consequences of diabetes and their variation over time and between countries. METHODS: Cause-specific mortality was analysed in follow-up from 1966-1970 to December 1992 of 5783 members of the British Diabetic Association living in England and Wales during 1966-1970. Comparison was made with age-, sex- and calendar year-specific mortality by cause in the general population of England and Wales. RESULTS: During the follow-up 3399 (58.8\%) subjects died. The relative risk of all-cause mortality in the cohort compared to the general population was 2.31 in women and 1.58 in men (both P {$<$} 0.001).Relative risks were greater for women than men at almost all ages and for each major diabetes-related cause of death. Absolute excess ('attributable') mortality rates were also greater in women than in men, except at ages {$<$} 50. Half the deaths in each sex were from circulatory diseases and only 3.4\% were from renal disease. The relative risks of mortality for all-causes and circulatory diseases were particularly great at younger ages, but changed little with duration of follow-up. At ages {$<$} 40 the relative risks for all-causes were 3.75 in men and 5.51 in women and for ischaemic heart disease were 10.44 and 25.25 respectively (all P {$<$} 0.001). At these ages one-third of deaths were due to acute complications of diabetes, suicides and accidents, whereas at older ages these accounted for only 4\% of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rates at young ages in the cohort were around twice those in Sweden, Norway and Israel, suggesting that many of the deaths in England and Wales are preventable. The results also indicate a particular need for investigation and amelioration of cardiovascular risk factors in English and Welsh patients, especially women.},

Over this time, the age-adjusted, sarcoidosis-related mortality rate increased 50.5\% in women and 30.1\% in men. The greatest absolute increase in death rates was among non-Hispanic black females. Regardless of sex or race, mortality rates climbed most in decedents 55 years or older. The most common cause of death was sarcoidosis itself. Younger sarcoidosis decedents with pulmonary fibrosis were more likely to be black than white, and younger sarcoidosis decedents were more likely than similarly aged decedents in the general population to have a cardiac cause contribute to death., Conclusions: From 1988–2007, sarcoidosis-related mortality rates increased significantly, particularly in non-Hispanic black females aged 55 years or older. The underlying cause of death in most patients with sarcoidosis was the disease itself. Among young sarcoidosis decedents, those with pulmonary fibrosis or a cardiac cause contributing to death were more likely to be black than white.},

We studied the association of BMI measurements (at baseline, highest and lowest BMI during the study-period) and lifetime changes in BMI (calculated over different time periods (i.e. short time period: annual change in BMI between successive surveys, long time period: annual change in BMI over the entire study period) with mortality from any cancer, and lung, colorectal, prostate and breast cancer in a large cohort study (n=8,645. Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen, 1965-1990) with a follow-up on mortality status on December 31st 2008. We used multivariate Cox regression models with adjustments for age, smoking, sex, and place of residence. Being overweight at baseline was associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer mortality (hazard ratio (HR) =2.22; 95\% CI 1.19-4.17). Obesity at baseline was associated with a higher risk of any cancer mortality [all subjects (1.23 (1.01-1.50)), and females (1.40 (1.07-1.84))]. Chronically obese females (females who were obese during the entire study-period) had a higher risk of mortality from any cancer (2.16 (1.47-3.18), lung (3.22 (1.06-9.76)), colorectal (4.32 (1.53-12.20)), and breast cancer (2.52 (1.15-5.54)). We found no significant association between long-term annual change in BMI and cancer mortality risk. Both short-term annual increase and decrease in BMI were associated with a lower mortality risk from any cancer [all subjects: (0.67 (0.47-0.94)) and (0.73 (0.55-0.97)), respectively]. In conclusion, a higher BMI is associated with a higher cancer mortality risk. This study is the first to show that short-term annual changes in BMI were associated with lower mortality from any type of cancer.},

  abstract = {Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption have not been clearly related to the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and the impact of these two factors on survival of NHL patients has received little attention. Cases were 268 subjects with incident histologically-confirmed NHL, admitted as inpatients to the Division of Medical Oncology, between 1983 and 2002. These individuals were enrolled as cases in case-control studies conducted at the same institution over the same period. For all patients clinical (histological subtype, major prognostic factors and treatment) and epidemiological data (smoking and drinking habits) were available. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratio (HR) was estimated by Cox proportional hazard model. Compared to never smokers, patients who smoked ≥20 cigarettes/day had higher risks of death (HR = 1.70, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–2.73) and lower survivals at 5 years (60 and 46\%, respectively). Likewise, patients who drunk ≥4 drinks/day showed 1.69-fold higher probability of death (95\% CI: 1.04–2.76) in comparison to drinkers of {$<$}2 drinks/day (5-year survival: 47 and 67\%, respectively). When combining exposure to alcohol and tobacco, no excess of death emerged in light drinkers ({$<$}4 drinks/day), irrespective of their smoking habits, but higher risks of death emerged among heavy drinkers. In the present study, heavy tobacco smoking, and particularly, heavy alcohol drinking were associated with poor survival in NHL patients. Our findings strongly encourage physicians to advice NHL patients to stop smoking and diminish alcohol consumption to obtain improvements in the course of NHL. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Background: No population‐based cohort studies have been undertaken to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of gastric cancer. The purpose of this investigation was to clarify the incidence and fatal prognosis of gastric cancer and to determine the factors that contribute to the prognosis in a general Japanese population in Hisayama using a prospective study design. Methods: From 1988 to 1998 a total of 2605 subjects aged 40 years or older with no history of gastrectomy or gastric cancer were followed‐up prospectively after a health examination. The diagnosis of gastric cancer was based on clinical records or autopsy findings. Results: During the follow‐up period, 76 subjects developed gastric cancer. The age‐adjusted incidence of gastric cancer for men (4.9 per 1000 person‐years) was 4‐fold higher than that for women (1.2, P {$<$} 0.05). In men, the incidence of gastric cancer increased with advancing age, but this trend was not observed in women. The age‐ and sex‐adjusted 5‐year survival rate was significantly higher in cancers of the middle third of the stomach than in those of the upper third of the stomach. The survival rate was higher in cancers of well‐differentiated adenocarcinoma than in those of the other histological types. There were no cases of cancer‐related death among the early gastric cancers during the follow‐up period. Conclusions: Our data suggest that men are at higher risk of gastric cancer than women in the general Japanese population. Clinical stage, histological type, and site of cancer in the stomach contribute to a fatal prognosis.},

  abstract = {Background Current guidelines generally recommend watchful waiting until symptoms emerge for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Objectives The study sought to compare the long-term outcomes of initial AVR versus conservative strategies following the diagnosis of asymptomatic severe AS. Methods We used data from a large multicenter registry enrolling 3,815 consecutive patients with severe AS (peak aortic jet velocity {$>$}4.0 m/s, or mean aortic pressure gradient {$>$}40 mm~Hg, or aortic valve area~{$<$}1.0 cm2) between January 2003 and December 2011. Among 1,808 asymptomatic patients, the initial AVR and conservative strategies were chosen in 291 patients, and 1,517 patients, respectively. Median follow-up was 1,361 days with 90\% follow-up rate at 2~years. The propensity score–matched cohort of 582 patients (n~= 291 in each group) was developed as the main analysis set for the current report. Results Baseline characteristics of the propensity score–matched cohort were largely comparable, except for the slightly younger age and the greater AS severity in the initial AVR group. In the conservative group, AVR was performed in 41\% of patients during follow-up. The cumulative 5-year incidences of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization were significantly lower in the initial AVR group than in the conservative group (15.4\% vs. 26.4\%, p~= 0.009; 3.8\% vs. 19.9\%, p~{$<$} 0.001, respectively). Conclusions The long-term outcome of asymptomatic patients with severe AS was dismal when managed conservatively in this real-world analysis and might be substantially improved by an initial AVR strategy.

  abstract = {Objective The aim of the study reported here was to assess the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with endometrial cancer and to determine independent factors affecting the prognosis. Materials and methods This was a retrospective study of a single-center clinical series of 276 patients (mean age 64 years) with histologically confirmed cancer of the corpus uteri. The standard treatments were extrafascial total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with selective pelvic/para-aortic node dissection, according to risk for recurrence. Actuarial overall survival and disease-free survival were estimated according to the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to assess the prognostic significance of the different variables. Results The estimated median follow-up, determined using the inverse Kaplan–Meier method, was 45 months (95\% confidence interval [CI] 41.2–48.8) for disease-free survival and 46 months (95\% CI 43.0–49.0) for overall survival. The statistically significant variables affecting disease-free survival and overall survival were age, serous-papillary and clear-cell histological types, outer-half myometrial invasion, advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, tumor grades G2 and G3, incomplete surgical resection, positive lymph nodes, lymphovascular space invasion, tumor remnants of {$>$}1 cm after surgery, and high-risk group. In the multivariate Cox regression model, predictors of tumor recurrence included advanced FIGO stage (hazard ratio [HR] 4.90, 95\% CI 2.57–9.36, P {$<$} 0.001) and tumor grades G2 (HR 4.79, 95\% CI 1.73–13.27, P = 0.003) and G3 (HR 7.56, 95\% CI 2.75–20.73, P {$<$} 0.001). The same variables were also associated with a significantly higher risk of tumor-related mortality. Conclusion FIGO stage and tumor grade were independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival and overall survival in endometrial cancer patients. Outcome was also influenced by histopathologic type, myometrial and lymphovascular space invasion, lymph-node involvement, age, and tumor remnants after surgery, although a larger study sample is probably needed to demonstrate the independent association of these variables with survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise is generally recommended for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some studies evaluate an exercise intervention including diet or behaviour modification or both, and the effects of diet and exercise are not differentiated. Some exercise studies involve low participant numbers, lacking power to show significant differences which may appear in larger trials. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and manual searches of bibliographies. Date of last search was March 3, 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials comparing any type of well-documented aerobic, fitness or progressive resistance training exercise with no exercise in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Any information on adverse effects was collected from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen randomised controlled trials comparing exercise against no exercise in type 2 diabetes were identified involving 377 participants. Trials ranged from eight weeks to twelve months duration. Compared with the control, the exercise intervention significantly improved glycaemic control as indicated by a decrease in glycated haemoglobin levels of 0.6\% (-0.6 \% HbA(1c), 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.9 to -0.3; P {$<$} 0.05). This result is both statistically and clinically significant. There was no significant difference between groups in whole body mass, probably due to an increase in fat free mass (muscle) with exercise, as reported in one trial (6.3 kg, 95\% CI 0.0 to 12.6). There was a reduction in visceral adipose tissue with exercise (-45.5 cm(2), 95\% CI -63.8 to -27.3), and subcutaneous adipose tissue also decreased. No study reported adverse effects in the exercise group or diabetic complications. The exercise intervention significantly increased insulin response (131 AUC, 95\% CI 20 to 242) (one trial), and decreased plasma triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/L, 95\% CI -0.48 to -0.02). No significant difference was found between groups in quality of life (one trial), plasma cholesterol or blood pressure. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss},

Methods: A population-based sample of men aged 65–74 years were randomized individually to invitation to ultrasound screening (invited group) or to a control group not offered screening. Patients with an AAA (3·0 cm or larger) detected at screening underwent surveillance and were offered surgery after predefined criteria had been met. Cause-specific mortality data were analysed using Cox regression. Results: Some 67 770 men were enrolled in the study. Over 13 years, there were 224 AAA-related deaths in the invited group and 381 in the control group, a 42 (95 per cent confidence interval 31 to 51) per cent reduction. There was no evidence of effect on other causes of death, but there was an overall reduction in all-cause mortality of 3 (1 to 5) per cent. The degree of benefit seen in earlier years of follow-up was slightly diminished by the occurrence of AAA ruptures in those with an aorta originally screened normal. About half of these ruptures had a baseline aortic diameter in the range 2·5–2·9 cm. It was estimated that 216 men need to be invited to screening to save one death over the next 13 years. Conclusion: Screening resulted in a reduction in all-cause mortality, and the benefit in AAA-related mortality continued to accumulate throughout follow-up.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based, nationwide cohort study including all incident MS cases in Denmark with first MS symptom between 1980 and 2005. To investigate the time of diagnosis, we compared individuals with and without chronic comorbidity using multinomial logistic regression. To investigate mortality, we used Cox regression with time-dependent covariates, following study participants from clinical MS onset until endpoint (death) or to the end of the study, censuring at emigration. RESULTS: We identified 8,947 individuals with clinical onset of MS between 1980 and 2005. In the study of time of diagnosis, we found statistically significant odds ratios for longer diagnostic delays with cerebrovascular comorbidity (2.01 [1.44-2.80]; {$<$}0.0005), cardiovascular comorbidity (4.04 [2.78-5.87]; {$<$}0.0005), lung comorbidity (1.93 [1.42-2.62]; {$<$}0.0005), diabetes comorbidity (1.78 [1.04-3.06]; 0.035), and cancer comorbidity (2.10 [1.20-3.67]; 0.009).

Design: An ongoing observational cohort study collating routinely collected clinical data on HIV-positive individuals attending for care at HIV treatment centres throughout the United Kingdom. Methods: Individuals were included if they had been seen for care from 2004 onwards and had tested for HBV and HCV. Crude mortality rates (all cause, liver related, and AIDS related) were calculated among HIV-monoinfected individuals and those coinfected with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV. Poisson regression was used to adjust for confounding factors, identify independent predictors of mortality, and estimate the impact of hepatitis coinfection on mortality in this cohort. Results: Among 25{$\mkern1mu$}486 HIV-positive individuals, with a median follow-up 4.5 years, HBV coinfection was significantly associated with increased all-cause and liver-related mortality in multivariable analyses: adjusted rate ratios (ARR) [95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI)] were 1.60 (1.28–2.00) and 10.42 (5.78–18.80), respectively. HCV coinfection was significantly associated with increased all-cause (ARR 1.43, 95\% CI 1.15–1.76) and liver-related mortality (ARR 6.20, 95\% CI 3.31–11.60). Neither HBV nor HCV coinfection were associated with increased AIDS-related mortality: ARRs (95\% CI) 1.07 (0.63–1.83) and 0.40 (0.20–0.81), respectively. Conclusion: The increased rate of all-cause and liver-related mortality among hepatitis-coinfected individuals in this HIV-positive cohort highlights the need for primary prevention and access to effective hepatitis treatment for HIV-positive individuals.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Limited data exist on patients with cardiac cachexia or morbid obesity presenting for valvular heart surgery. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between body mass index and morbidity and mortality after valvular surgery. METHODS: A retrospective review of 4247 patients undergoing valvular surgery from 1996 to 2008 at Emory University Healthcare Hospitals was performed. Patients were divided into 3 groups: body mass index 24 or less (group 1, n = 1527), body mass index 25 to 35 (group 2, n = 2284), and body mass index 36 or more (group 3, n = 436). Data were analyzed using multivariable regression analysis, adjusted for 10 preoperative covariates. A smooth kernel regression curve was generated using body mass index and in-hospital mortality as variables. Long-term survival comparisons were made using adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated that provide survival estimates for long-term mortality using the Social Security Death Index. RESULTS: Patients in group 3 were significantly younger (group 1, 61.7 ± 16.1 years; group 2, 61.9 ± 13.6; group 3, 57.5 ± 13.0; P {$<$} .001) and more likely to be female (group 1, 778/1527 [51.0\%]; group 2, 912/2284 [39.9\%]; group 3, 240/436 [55.0\%]; P {$<$} .001). Mean ejection fractions were similar among groups (P = .51). Patients in group 2 had significantly shorter postoperative length of stay (group 1, 9.6 ± 10.3 days; group 2, 8.7 ± 8.2 days; group 3, 10.8 ± 11.0 days; P {$<$} .001). In-hospital mortality for the entire cohort was 5.8\% (245/4247), and by group was 111 of 1527 (7.3\%) in group 1, 110 of 2284 (4.8\%) in group 2, and 24 of 436 (5.5\%) in group 3 (P = .006). Actual survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years was significantly lower in group 1 (P {$<$} .001). A lower body mass index was a significant independent predictor for both in-hospital and long-term mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with body mass index 24 or less are at significantly increased risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality after cardiac valvular surgery. This high-risk patient population warrants careful risk stratification and options for less-invasive valve therapies.},

  abstract = {The introduction of second-generation antipsychotic drugs during the 1990s is widely believed to have adversely affected mortality of patients with schizophrenia. Our aim was to establish the long-term contribution of antipsychotic drugs to mortality in such patients. Nationwide registers in Finland were used to compare the cause-specific mortality in 66\hphantom{,}881 patients versus the total population (5·2 million) between 1996, and 2006, and to link these data with the use of antipsychotic drugs. We measured the all-cause mortality of patients with schizophrenia in outpatient care during current and cumulative exposure to any antipsychotic drug versus no use of these drugs, and exposure to the six most frequently used antipsychotic drugs compared with perphenazine use. Although the proportional use of second-generation antipsychotic drugs rose from 13\% to 64\% during follow-up, the gap in life expectancy between patients with schizophrenia and the general population did not widen between 1996 (25 years), and 2006 (22·5 years). Compared with current use of perphenazine, the highest risk for overall mortality was recorded for quetiapine (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·41, 95\% CI 1·09–1·82), and the lowest risk for clozapine (0·74, 0·60–0·91; p=0·0045 for the difference between clozapine vs perphenazine, and p{$<$}0·0001 for all other antipsychotic drugs). Long-term cumulative exposure (7–11 years) to any antipsychotic treatment was associated with lower mortality than was no drug use (0·81, 0·77–0·84). In patients with one or more filled prescription for an antipsychotic drug, an inverse relation between mortality and duration of cumulative use was noted (HR for trend per exposure year 0·991; 0·985–0·997). Long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs is associated with lower mortality compared with no antipsychotic use. Second-generation drugs are a highly heterogeneous group, and clozapine seems to be associated with a substantially lower mortality than any other antipsychotics. Restrictions on the use of clozapine should be reassessed. Annual EVO Financing (Special government subsidies from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Finland).},

Sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary hypertension is a well described, but not common, complication of sarcoidosis. In small scale studies, it has been previously described as manifestation of advanced disease and was found to be associated increased morbidity and mortality. This study sought to assess the long-term prognostic significance of sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary hypertension (SAPH) by using data obtained from a large population-based registry which contains longitudinal follow-up data. Methods Utilizing the records of the largest healthcare provider in Israel, we extracted a cohort consisting of sarcoidosis patients and age-and-sex matched controls. Dates of sarcoidosis registration, pulmonary hypertension and death, as well as anthropometric information and medical comorbidities, were extracted from the database. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to find variables associated with pulmonary hypertension. Cox proportional hazards method and log-rank test were used for survival analysis. Results The cohort included 3993 sarcoidosis patients and 19,856 controls. Pulmonary hypertension was observed among 269 sarcoidosis patients (6.74\%) vs. 400 controls (2.01\%). Sarcoidosis was found as independently associated with pulmonary hypertension (OR 3.17). After a mean follow-up of 7.49 years (median 7.24, maximum 17.88 years), 710 (17.8\%) of the sarcoidosis patients and 2121 (10.7\%) of the controls had died. Both sarcoidosis and pulmonary hypertension were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.82 and HR 2.31, respectively). Conclusions SAPH is associated with a poor prognosis. Proper screening methods may assess whether early identification and treatment improve life expectancy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pathologic stage is a critically important prognostic factor after radical cystectomy (RC) that is used to guide the use of secondary therapies. However, the risk of disease recurrence, for patients clinically diagnosed with muscle-invasive tumors who are found not to have muscle-invasive disease at RC are poorly defined. Therefore, we reviewed the long-term outcomes in patients who were downstaged to non-invasive urothelial carcinoma at time of RC. METHODS: We identified 1,177 consecutive patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who underwent radical cystectomy at our institution between 1980 and 1999 without neoadjuvant therapy. Postoperative disease recurrence and survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the impact of pathologic stage on survival. RESULTS: Pathologic downstaging to non-muscle invasive disease was identified in 538 (45.7 \%) patients. The 10-year cancer-specific survival was 84.1, 77.4, 71.1 and 58.5 \% for those with pT0, pTis, pT1 and pT2 tumors, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the risk of cancer-specific mortality was significantly decreased for patients with non-muscle invasive disease than those with organ-confined muscle invasion (RR-0.39; p = 0.002). There was no difference in disease-specific mortality among patients who had non-invasive (pT0, pTa, or pTis) disease (p = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Downstaging from clinical muscle-invasive bladder cancer to non-muscle invasive disease at RC is associated with a significant reduction in cancer-specific mortality. However, even patients with residual non-muscle invasive disease may suffer disease recurrence and require continued surveillance after surgery.},

  abstract = {Current guidelines identify people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as being at high risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Because as many as 19 million Americans may have CKD, a comprehensive summary of this risk would be potentially useful for planning public health policy. A systematic review of the association between non–dialysis-dependent CKD and the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was conducted. Patient- and study-related characteristics that influenced the magnitude of these associations also were investigated. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched, and reference lists through December 2004 were consulted. Authors of 10 primary studies provided additional data. Cohort studies or cohort analyses of randomized, controlled trials that compared mortality between those with and without chronically reduced kidney function were included. Studies were excluded from review when participants were followed for {$<$}1 yr or had ESRD. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study setting, quality, participant and renal function characteristics, and outcomes. Thirty-nine studies that followed a total of 1,371,990 participants were reviewed. The unadjusted relative risk for mortality in participants with reduced kidney function compared with those without ranged from 0.94 to 5.0 and was significantly more than 1.0 in 93\% of cohorts. Among the 16 studies that provided suitable data, the absolute risk for death increased exponentially with decreasing renal function. Fourteen cohorts described the risk for mortality from reduced kidney function, after adjustment for other established risk factors. Although adjusted relative hazards were consistently lower than unadjusted relative risks (median reduction 17\%), they remained significantly more than 1.0 in 71\% of cohorts. This review supports current guidelines that identify individuals with CKD as being at high risk for cardiovascular mortality. Determining which interventions best offset this risk remains a health priority.},

  abstract = {Background: The association of obesity with ovarian cancer survival is controversial, as most studies have reported null associations. A limitation, however, is that the majority of previous studies used retrospectively collected weight data among women who had already developed ovarian cancer, hence recall bias cannot be ruled out. To the best of our knowledge, only one study, conducted within the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), used prospectively collected weight data. The study reported no association between pre-diagnosis obesity and ovarian cancer survival. Further, there is a dearth of data on the association of pre-diagnosis physical activity with ovarian cancer survival. In this study, we evaluated the associations of pre-diagnosis obesity and physical activity with ovarian cancer survival among women enrolled in a larger prospective study in the U.S. Methods: The NIH-AARP Diet and Health study includes 340,148 men and 227,021 women aged 50-71 years, who completed mailed questionnaires at baseline in 1995-1996. We identified 741 incident cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed after study enrollment. Follow-up for survival started from the date of ovarian cancer diagnosis to death or last known date alive (December 31, 2011). Mortality was ascertained by linkage with the National Death Index Plus. Pre-diagnosis body mass index ((BMI) was computed from self-reported height and weight (kg/m2). We categorized BMI into four groups: {$<$}25 (reference), 25-29.99, 30-34.99, and ≥35 kg/m2. Baseline physical activity was categorized as never/rarely (reference), 1-3 times/month, 1-2 times/week, 3-4 times/week, and ≥ 5 times/week. A subset of study participants were sent an additional questionnaire where various levels of physical activity was assessed weekly as never/rarely, {$<$}1 hr, 1-3 hrs, 4-7 hrs, and {$>$}7 hrs. We used Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted for age at enrollment, time from entry to cancer diagnosis, hysterectomy status, cancer stage, alcohol intake to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of survival by categories of BMI and physical activity. Results: Five hundred and forty-nine (549) deaths occurred during an average follow-up of 3 years (range 0-14.2). The mean age at enrollment was 63 years, while the mean BMI was 26.7kg/m2. More than half of the women (56.9\%) were overweight at baseline. In multivariable adjusted model, pre-diagnosis obesity was associated with reduced overall survival. The HRs were 1.18 (95\%CI 0.96-1.45), 1.05 (95\%CI 0.82-1.36), and 1.59 (95\%CI 1.16-2.18, p-trend = 0.02), respectively comparing women with BMI 25-29.99, 30-34.99, and ≥35 to those with BMI {$<$}25 kg/m2. The results were similar when women diagnosed within the first 2 years of study enrollment were excluded; HR=1.72 (95\%CI 1.21-2.42, p-trend ≤0.01) comparing women with BMI ≥35 kg/m2 to those with BMI {$<$}25 kg/m2. Pre-diagnosis physical activity did not show similar relations with survival. The HR comparing women who engaged in vigorous physical activity {$>$}5 times/week was 0.98 (95\%CI 0.75-1.28) compared to those who rarely/never engaged in vigorous physical activity. Although women who engaged in 4-7 hours/week of moderate/vigorous physical activity had better survival (HR=0.67, 95\%CI=0.48-0.94), no such association was seen for those engaging in similar activities for {$>$}7 hours/week (HR=0.92, 95\%CI=0.65-1.31, p-trend=0.16). Light physical activity was not associated with ovarian cancer survival. Conclusion: In this prospective study, obesity prior to ovarian cancer diagnosis was associated with reduced survival. Our findings provide important new insights regarding the effects of obesity on ovarian cancer survival, and underscore the importance of maintaining a healthy weight.

NAFLD occurs in children and adults of all ethnicities and includes isolated fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Patients with NASH are at risk for developing cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma and have increased all-cause mortality. NAFLD is associated with a variety of clinical conditions and is an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of NAFLD and the specific steps that lead to NASH and advanced fibrosis are not fully understood, although researchers have found that a combination of environmental, genetic, and metabolic factors lead to advanced disease. There have been improvements in noninvasive radiographic methods to diagnose NAFLD, especially for advanced disease. However, liver biopsy is still the standard method of diagnosis for NASH. There are many challenges to treating patients with NASH, and no therapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; multimodal approaches are being developed and becoming the standard of care. We review pathogenesis and treatment approaches for the West's largest liver-related public health concern.},

The 90-day case fatality was 19\%. By 90 days after stroke 20,147 (58\%) were diagnosed as having hypertension, of whom 75\% had received antihypertensive treatment after stroke. After 5 years 68\% of the hypertensive stroke patients receiving antihypertensive treatment were alive, while this proportion for patients not prescribed antihypertensive treatment was 59\%.

The objectives of the present study were to assess the long-term survival of a contemporary cohort of patients discharged after a first hospitalization for HF and identify variables associated with adverse outcome. Methods We prospectively included consecutive patients (n=735) discharged from 11 healthcare establishments of the Somme department (France) after a first hospitalization for HF during 2000. The 7-year observed survival was compared with the expected survival of the general population. Results Mean age of the study group was 75±12~years and 48\% of patients were women. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured in 628 patients (85\%). During the 7-year follow-up, 483 patients (67\%) died. The 5- and 7-year observed survival rates were dramatically lower than the expected survival of the matched general population (42\% vs. 70\%, and 33\% vs. 59\%, respectively). Relative survival (observed/expected survival) was 60\% at 5~years and 55\% at 7~years. Multivariable analysis identified cancer, stroke, diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, age, and hyponatraemia as independent predictors of 7-year mortality. Conclusions In Europe, the long-term outcome of patients with new-onset HF is still extremely poor. Better implementation of guideline-oriented therapeutic strategies is needed to improve prognosis of this increasingly prevalent condition.},

  abstract = {Objectives To estimate mortality rates and prognostic factors in HIV-positive patients who started combination antiretroviral therapy between 1996–1999 and survived for more than ten years. Methods We used data from 18 European and North American HIV cohort studies contributing to the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration. We followed up patients from ten years after start of combination antiretroviral therapy. We estimated overall and cause-specific mortality rate ratios for age, sex, transmission through injection drug use, AIDS, CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA. Results During 50,593 person years 656/13,011 (5\%) patients died. Older age, male sex, injecting drug use transmission, AIDS, and low CD4 count and detectable viral replication ten years after starting combination antiretroviral therapy were associated with higher subsequent mortality. CD4 count at ART start did not predict mortality in models adjusted for patient characteristics ten years after start of antiretroviral therapy. The most frequent causes of death (among 340 classified) were non-AIDS cancer, AIDS, cardiovascular, and liver-related disease. Older age was strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality, injecting drug use transmission with non-AIDS infection and liver-related mortality, and low CD4 and detectable viral replication ten years after starting antiretroviral therapy with AIDS mortality. Five-year mortality risk was {$<$}5\% in 60\% of all patients, and in 30\% of those aged over 60 years. Conclusions Viral replication, lower CD4 count, prior AIDS, and transmission via injecting drug use continue to predict higher all-cause and AIDS-related mortality in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for over a decade. Deaths from AIDS and non-AIDS infection are less frequent than deaths from other non-AIDS causes.},

However, the exact cause of death related to the excessive use of alcohol has not been fully explored. Aim To assess the effect of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) on all-cause, liver-related and cardiovascular mortality using population-based data. Methods Data were obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) Linked Mortality Files. Alcohol consumption was estimated as grams per day. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was utilised to assess the effects of ALD on follow-up time to mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease and liver disease. Results A total of 8,306 participants were included [ALD (n = 148)]. Mortality follow-up data were available for a median time of 178.27 months. Participants with ALD had increased risk for liver-related mortality [adjusted hazard ratios or aHR 7.06 (2.09–23.79)], but not for overall mortality [aHR 1.14 (0.70–1.85)] or cardiovascular mortality [aHR 0.61 (0.11–3.25)]. Conclusion Alcoholic liver disease increases the risks for liver-related mortality but not for cardiac or overall mortality.},

The impact of COPD on mortality in HIV remains unclear. We examined associations between markers of COPD and mortality among PLWH and uninfected subjects. Design Longitudinal analysis of the Examinations of HIV-Associated Lung Emphysema (EXHALE) cohort study. Methods EXHALE includes 196 PLWH and 165 uninfected smoking-matched subjects who underwent pulmonary function testing and CT scans to define COPD and were followed. We determined associations between markers of COPD with mortality using multivariable Cox regression models, adjusted for smoking and the VACS Index, a validated predictor of mortality in HIV. Results Median follow-up time was 6.9 years; the mortality rate was 2.7 per 100-person-years among PLWH and 1.7 per 100-person-years among uninfected subjects (p=0.11). The VACS Index was associated with mortality in both PLWH and uninfected subjects. In multivariable models, pulmonary function and CT characteristics defining COPD were associated with mortality in PLWH: those with airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC{$<$}0.7) had 3.1 times the risk of death (HR 3.1 [95\% CI 1.4–7.1]), compared to those without; those with emphysema ({$>$}10\% burden) had 2.4 times the risk of death (HR 2.4 [95\% CI 1.1–5.5]) compared to those with ≤10\% emphysema. In uninfected subjects, pulmonary variables were not significantly associated with mortality, which may reflect fewer deaths limiting power. Conclusions Markers of COPD were associated with greater mortality in PWLH, independent of the VACS Index. COPD is likely an important contributor to mortality in contemporary PLWH.},

We aimed to examine whether mortality in people with diabetes improved over time in the 1999 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).METHODSWe conducted a prospective cohort study using 1999 to 2004 and 2005 to 2010 data from the NHANES. For primary analyses, we compared the unadjusted, age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for mortality outcomes (total, cardiovascular, cardiac and cancer deaths) of the participants with diabetes with those without diabetes using Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTSFor each mortality outcome, HR (95\% confidence interval) in diabetic participants during the period 2005 to 2010 was lower than that during the period 1999 to 2004 (all-cause death, 2.76 [1.87-4.08] vs 4.23 [2.57-6.98]; cardiovascular death, 2.70 [1.20-6.04] vs 8.82 [3.28-23.70]; cardiac death, 2.45 [0.98-6.09] vs 15.55 [7.01-34.50]; cancer death, 2.33 [0.87-6.23] vs 3.03 [1.20-7.65]). Compared with mortality outcome during the period 1999 to 2004, greater declines in mortality during the period 2005 to 2010 were observed for cardiovascular (-54.0\%) and cardiac deaths (-64.8\%). In age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted models, the cumulative event rates for total, cardiovascular and cardiac deaths were not significantly different between participants with and without diabetes during the period 2005-2010; this was not the case during the period 1999-2004. The leading cause of death was malignant neoplasm during the period 2005-2010.CONCLUSIONConsiderably improved outcomes for total, cardiovascular and cardiac deaths were observed in people with diabetes during the 2005 to 2010 NHANES compared to the 1999 to 2004 NHANES.},

  abstract = {Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct peripheral T-lymphocytic malignancy associated with a retrovirus designated human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subclassification into the following four categories: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic and smoldering subtypes are considered indolent and are usually managed with watchful waiting until disease progression, analogous to the management of some patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or other indolent histology lymphomas. Patients with aggressive ATL generally have a poor prognosis because of multidrug resistance of malignant cells, a large tumor burden with multiorgan failure, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent infectious complications as a result of a profound T-cell immunodeficiency. Under the sponsorship of the 13th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV, a group of ATL researchers joined to form a consensus statement based on established data to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, and treatment strategies. A set of response criteria specific for ATL reflecting a combination of those for lymphoma and CLL was proposed. Clinical subclassification is useful but is limited because of the diverse prognosis among each subtype. Molecular abnormalities within the host genome, such as tumor suppressor genes, may account for these diversities. A treatment strategy based on the clinical subclassification and prognostic factors is suggested, including watchful waiting approach, chemotherapy, antiviral therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and targeted therapies.},

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting 23 Dutch pacemaker centres Patients Pre-implantation characteristics of 1517 patients receiving a first bradycardia PM between 2003–2007 were studied in relation to survival. Interventions None; patients were followed up during routine clinical practice. Main outcome measures Cause and time to death. Results At the end of a mean follow-up of 5.8 (SD 1.1) years, 512 patients (33\%) died, mostly of non-cardiac cause (67\%). There were two PM related deaths. Survival rates were 93\%, 81\%, 69\%, and 61\% after 1, 3, 5 and 7 years, respectively. PM recipients without concomitant cardiovascular disease at implantation showed survival rates comparable to age and sex matched controls. Predictors at time of implantation associated with cardiac mortality were: age, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, heart failure, valve disease, and the indication for PM implantation. Predictors for all cause mortality were: male gender, age, body mass index, CAD, cardiac surgery, diabetes, heart failure, and maintained atrioventricular synchrony. Conclusions A pre-implantation history of heart failure, CAD, and diabetes are the most important predictors for worse prognosis in PM recipients. Without baseline heart disease, survival rates equal that of the general population, suggesting that the prognosis of contemporary PM recipients is mainly determined by comorbid diseases and a bradycardia pacing indication as such does not influence survival.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease mortality rates have been decreasing in the United Kingdom since the 1970s. Our study aimed to examine how much of the decrease in England and Wales between 1981 and 2000 could be attributed to medical and surgical treatments and how much to changes in cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: The IMPACT mortality model was used to combine and analyze data on uptake and effectiveness of cardiological treatments and risk factor trends in England and Wales. The main data sources were published trials and meta-analyses, official statistics, clinical audits, and national surveys. Between 1981 and 2000, coronary heart disease mortality rates in England and Wales decreased by 62\% in men and 45\% in women 25 to 84 years old. This resulted in 68 230 fewer deaths in 2000. Some 42\% of this decrease was attributed to treatments in individuals (including 11\% to secondary prevention, 13\% to heart failure treatments, 8\% to initial treatments of acute myocardial infarction, and 3\% to hypertension treatments) and 58\% to population risk factor reductions (principally smoking, 48\%; blood pressure, 9.5\%; and cholesterol, 9.5\%). Adverse trends were seen for physical activity, obesity and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: More than half the coronary heart disease mortality decrease in Britain between 1981 and 2000 was attributable to reductions in major risk factors, principally smoking. This emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive strategy that promotes primary prevention, particularly for tobacco and diet, and that maximizes population coverage of effective treatments, especially for secondary prevention and heart failure. These findings may be cautiously generalizable to the United States and other developed countries},

However, there is no single comprehensive source of information to support CHD prevention and treatment strategies. Therefore this study evaluated the availability and quality of UK CHD data sources since 1981. DESIGN: Data sources for England and Wales were identified and appraised on: (1) CHD patient numbers (myocardial infarction, angina, hypertension, and heart failure); (2) uptake of medical and surgical CHD treatments, and (3) population trends in major cardiovascular risk factors. SETTING: England and Wales (population 53 million). Main results: Population and mortality data were easily accessible from Office for National Statistics and British Heart Foundation Annual CHD Statistics; population based risk factor data came principally from the British Regional Heart Study, the General Household Survey, and the Health Survey for England. They were limited for 1981, but more extensive by 2000. Hospital admissions information since 1998 was available online from HES; but trend data and details of interventions were scant. Limited primary care data on consultation rates, prescribing, and treatment uptake were available from published audits and studies. CONCLUSIONS: Information on CHD in the UK is fragmented, patchy, and mixed in quality. Data for women, the elderly populatiom, and ethnic minorities were particularly scarce, exacerbating inequalities. Future CHD disease monitoring and evaluation will require comprehensive and accurate population based information on trends in patient numbers, treatment uptake, and risk factors},

We examined whether hepatic steatosis on ultrasound and liver enzyme activities were associated with increased liver disease mortality in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1988-1994, with up to 23 years of linked-mortality data. Methods Survey-linked National Death Index records were analyzed among 14,527 adult participants who were negative for viral hepatitis B and C and iron overload. Hepatic steatosis on ultrasound was categorized as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation was defined as the highest sex-specific decile. Results Cumulative mortality was 36.2\% from all causes, including 16.3\% from cardiovascular disease, 10.8\% from cancer, 5.4\% from diabetes, and 1.1\% from liver disease. Severe hepatic steatosis was associated with increased liver disease mortality in both age-adjusted (hazard ratio [HR], 3.92; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-10.27, p for trend, 0.011) and multivariate-adjusted analyses (HR, 2.68; 95\% CI, 1.02-7.03; p for trend, 0.072). Hepatic steatosis was not independently associated with mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes. Higher liver disease mortality was found with elevated ALT (HR, 4.08; 95\% CI,1.99-8.33), AST (HR, 4.33; 95\% CI, 2.18-8.59), and GGT (HR, 7.91; 95\% CI, 3.06-20.46). GGT elevation was associated with increased overall mortality (HR, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.21-1.74). Liver enzymes were, otherwise, unrelated to overall or cause-specific mortality. Conclusion In the U.S. population, severe hepatic steatosis on ultrasound and liver enzyme elevation were associated with increased liver disease mortality, but were not independently associated with mortality from all causes (except for GGT), cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes.},

This review focuses primarily on the data from a recently published Caucasian-predominant population-based cohort from Olmsted County, Minnesota. Overall, the incidence rate was 10.0 per 100,000 population, which suggested that sarcoidosis is less common in Caucasians than in Blacks, but is more common in Caucasians than in Asians. Intrathoracic involvement was seen in the vast majority of patients, but less than half have respiratory symptoms. The most common extra-thoracic manifestations were skin rash followed by arthralgia, ophthalmologic involvement, hepatic involvement, splenomegaly, renal involvement, neurological involvement, extra-thoracic lymphadenopathy, exocrine gland involvement, upper respiratory tract involvement and cardiac involvement. Compared to sex and age-matched subjects, patients with sarcoidosis suffer from increased rates of cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism and hospitalized infection.},

  abstract = {Objective To characterize the epidemiology of sarcoidosis from 1946 through~2013. Patients and Methods An inception cohort of patients with incident sarcoidosis from January 1, 1976, through December 31, 2013, in Olmsted County, Minnesota, was identified based on comprehensive individual medical record review. Inclusion required physician diagnosis supported by histopathologic confirmation, radiologic features of intrathoracic sarcoidosis, and a compatible clinical presentation. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, and mortality. The data were augmented with a previously identified cohort of Olmsted County residents diagnosed as having sarcoidosis in 1946-1975. Incidence rates were age and sex adjusted to the 2010 US white population. Results A total of 448 incident cases of sarcoidosis were identified (mean age, 44.2 years; 52\% women). The annual incidence of sarcoidosis was 10.0 per 100,000 population. The incidence of sarcoidosis increased in women from 1950 to 1960, but otherwise there were no significant calendar year trends. However, the peak age at incidence for women shifted from 40 to 59 years in 1950 to 50 to 69 years in 2010. Similarly, the peak age at incidence for men shifted from 30 to 49 years in 1950 to 40 to 59 years in 2010. Ninety-seven percent of patients had intrathoracic involvement, but only 43\% had respiratory symptoms. The overall mortality of patients with sarcoidosis was not different from that of the general population (standardized mortality ratio=0.90; 95\% CI, 0.74-1.08). Conclusion Sarcoidosis occurred in approximately 10 persons per 100,000 per year. Most of the patients had intrathoracic involvement, although less than half had respiratory symptoms. Overall mortality was not different from that of the general population.},

Methods A cohort of Olmsted County, Minnesota residents first diagnosed with sarcoidosis between January 1, 1976 and December 31, 2013 was identified through the medical record-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Diagnosis was verified based on individual medical record review. A cohort of sex and age-matched comparators without sarcoidosis was assembled from the same population. Data on 18 chronic conditions recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services for both cases and comparators were retrieved and compared. Results The prevalence of multimorbidity (i.e., the presence of 2 or more chronic conditions) was similar between the 2 groups (111/345 cases and 110/345 comparator, P=.99). After index date, 156 cases and 142 comparators developed multimorbidity, corresponding to HR of 1.60 (95\% CI, 1.27 – 2.01; P{$<$}.001). The cumulative incidence of the presence of ≥ 3, 4 and 5 chronic conditions was also consistently significantly higher among cases than comparators. Analysis by specific type of chronic condition revealed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke/transient ischemic attack, arthritis, depression, diabetes and major osteoporotic fracture. Conclusion In this population, patients with sarcoidosis had a significantly higher risk of developing multimorbidity compared with sex and age-matched subjects without sarcoidosis.},

  abstract = {Limited data have suggested that an "obesity paradox" exists for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Much less is known about the role of the preoperative body mass index (BMI) in patients undergoing valve surgery. We evaluated 2,640 consecutive patients who underwent valve surgery between April 2004 and March 2011. The patients were classified by the World Health Organization standards as "underweight" (BMI 11.5 to 18.4 kg/m(2), n = 61), "normal weight" (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2), n = 865), "overweight" (BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2), n = 1,020), and "obese" (BMI 30 to 60.5 kg/m(2), n = 694). Mortality was ascertained using the Social Security Death Index. Hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for known preoperative risk factors, were obtained using Cox regression models. The mean follow-up was 31.9 ± 20.5 months. The long-term mortality rate was 1.21, 0.52, 0.32, and 0.44 per 10 years of person-time for underweight, normal, overweight, and obese patients, respectively. Compared to the normal BMI category, overweight patients (adjusted HR 0.60, 95\% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.79, p {$<$}0.001) and obese patients (adjusted HR 0.67, 95\% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.91, p = 0.009) were at a lower hazard of long-term all-cause mortality. Underweight patients remained at a greater adjusted risk of long-term mortality than normal weight patients (adjusted HR 1.69, 95\% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.85, p = 0.048). Similar patterns of mortality outcomes were noted in the subset of patients undergoing isolated valve surgery. In conclusion, overweight and obese patients had greater survival after valve surgery than patients with a normal BMI. Very lean patients undergoing valve surgery are at a greater hazard for mortality and might require more rigorous preoperative candidate screening and closer postoperative monitoring.},

Survival analysis of patients with SCI, at individual and population level, is important for public health management and the assessment of treatment achievements. The current study evaluated survival following traumatic and non-traumatic SCI worldwide. A systematic review was conducted, and all included papers were assessed for quality using a purposely designed assessment form. Survival data were presented in Kaplan–Meier curves and compared using the log-rank test. Sixteen studies were included of which 11 concerned traumatic SCI, four non-traumatic SCI, and one both. Crude standard mortality rates (SMRs) revealed that overall mortality in SCI is up to three times higher than in the general population. Survival rates were statistically significantly lower in non-traumatic SCI than in traumatic SCI (log-rank p\,=\,0.000). Age at injury, neurological level, extent of lesion, and year of injury have been described as predictors of survival. Causes of death stem from secondary complications, with failure of the respiratory system being the leading cause. This is the first systematic literature review on survival analysis following SCI worldwide. An increase in survival over time was found. However, the SMRs of individuals with SCI still exceed those of an age-matched non-disabled population, mainly due to secondary complications. Lower survival rates were observed in non-traumatic SCI compared with traumatic SCI.},

Nineteen subjects had an arm circumference of 34 cm or more (mean 40 cm) and the other 18 were considered to be non-obese and had a mean arm circumference of 30 cm. With each larger cuff, in terms of bladder surface area, auscultatory blood pressure decreased a few mm relative to intra-arterial pressure both for systolic and for diastolic measurements. Apart from diastolic pressure measured with the two 12 cm wide cuffs (12 X 23 cm, 12 X 30 cm) in the obese group all other auscultatory measurements differed less than 5\% from intra- arterial pressure, albeit with considerable variability among the subjects. The differences in error among measurements with the four largest cuffs in the obese group (13 X 30 cm, 14 X 30 cm, 14 X 38 cm, and a conical cuff) were clinically irrelevant, and there was even less to choose among all six cuffs in the non-obese subjects.

A cohort of 756 patients with AR was identified from our echocardiographic database. Chart reviews were performed. Survival as a function of TR severity was analysed. Of the 756 patients with severe AR, 264 (35\%) had ≥ 2+ TR. Univariate correlates of TR were older age (P {$<$} 0.0001), female gender (P {$<$} 0.0001), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (P {$<$} 0.0001), atrial fibrillation (P {$<$} 0.0001), presence of a pacemaker (P {$<$} 0.0001), higher PASP (P {$<$} 0.0001), presence of 3 or 4+ mitral regurgitation (P {$<$} 0.0001) and not being on a beta-blocker (P {$<$} 0.0001) or statins (P = 0.007). After adjusting for group differences, ≥ 2+ TR was an independent predictor of higher mortality (RR 1.47, P = 0.005).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite international practice guidelines endorsing radiotherapy (RT) as the preferred initial therapy, treatment approaches vary for patients with early-stage follicular lymphoma. The authors engaged the National Cancer Data Base to analyze patterns of care and survival outcomes for patients with early-stage follicular lymphoma in the era of modern therapy. METHODS A National Cancer Data Base retrospective cohort study was conducted of 35,961 patients with lymph node and extranodal, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to II, WHO grade 1 to 2 follicular lymphoma who were diagnosed between 1998 and 2012. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify sociodemographic, treatment, and tumor characteristics that were predictive of overall survival (OS) and treatment use. Propensity score-adjusted Cox proportional hazards ratios for survival in patients treated for follicular lymphoma were used. RESULTS Of the 35,961 patients with follicular lymphoma included in the current study, 63\% had stage I disease, 79\% were without extranodal disease, and 61\% were aged {$>$}60 years. RT use decreased from 37\% in 1999 to 24\% in 2012 (P{$<$}.0001), with corresponding significant increases in observation and single-agent chemotherapy. Patients who received RT had 5-year and 10-year OS rates of 86\% and 68\%, respectively, compared with 74\% and 54\%, respectively, for those who did not receive RT (P{$<$}.0001). On multivariable survival analysis, including a propensity score to account for potential uncaptured confounding variables due to a lack of randomization, upfront RT remained independently associated with improved OS (hazard ratio of death, 0.54; 95\% confidence interval, 0.47-0.63 [P{$<$}.0001]). CONCLUSIONS RT is an increasingly underused treatment approach in the era of modern therapy for patients with early-stage follicular lymphoma. The use of RT appears to improve OS and should remain standard practice as encouraged by clinical practice guidelines. Cancer 2015;121:3325–3334. © 2015 American Cancer Society.},

Methods and Results Consecutive US patients with newly implanted PM, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and CRT devices from a large remote monitoring database between 2008 and 2011 were included in this observational cohort study. Sex‐specific all‐cause survival postimplant was compared within each device type using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, stratified on age and adjusted for remote monitoring utilization and ZIP‐based socioeconomic variables. A total of 269~471 patients were assessed over a median 2.9 [interquartile range, 2.2, 3.6] years. Unadjusted mortality rates (MR; deaths/100~000~patient‐years) were similar between women versus men receiving PMs (n=115~076, 55\% male; MR 4193 versus MR 4256, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.84–0.90; P{$<$}0.001) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (n=85~014, 74\% male; MR 4417 versus MR 4479, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.93–1.02; P=0.244). In contrast, survival was superior in women receiving CRT defibrillators (n=61~475, 72\% male; MR 5270 versus male MR 7175; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.70–0.76; P{$<$}0.001) and also CRT pacemakers (n=7906, 57\% male; MR 5383 versus male MR 7625, adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.61–0.78; P{$<$}0.001). This relative difference increased with time. These results were unaffected by age or remote monitoring utilization. Conclusions Women accounted for less than 30\% of high‐voltage implants and fewer than half of low‐voltage implants in a large, nation‐wide cohort. Survival for women and men receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators and PMs was similar, but dramatically greater for women receiving both defibrillator‐ and PM‐based CRT.},

There was an overall age-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.52 (95\% confidence limits, 0.34 and 0.77) for women in the highest quartile of BMI compared to women in the lowest quartile, which was confined to an effect observed among women who were diagnosed at age 50 or earlier (IRR = 0.36). The association with BMI displayed an inverse dose-related trend (X2 for trend = 14.22, p {$<$} 0.001). The negative trend was particularly pronounced among non-smoking women (X2 = 14.63), and no clear trend associated with BMI was observed among women who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day (X1 = 0.41), indicating an interaction between BMI and cigarette smoking (X2 interaction = 3.86, p = 0.05).

Behaviors were self-reported through baseline interviews and up to three follow-up questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality after DCIS, with adjustment for patient sociodemographic, comorbidity, and treatment factors.ResultsOver a mean of 6.7 years of follow-up, 196 deaths occurred. All-cause mortality was elevated among women who were current smokers 1 year prior to diagnosis (HR = 2.17 [95\% CI 1.48, 3.18] vs. never smokers) and reduced among women with greater physical activity levels prior to diagnosis (HR = 0.55 [95\% CI: 0.35, 0.87] for ≥5 h per week vs. no activity). Moderate levels of post-diagnosis physical activity were associated with reduced all-cause mortality (HR = 0.31 [95\% CI 0.14, 0.68] for 2–5 h per week vs. no activity). Cancer-specific mortality was elevated among smokers and cardiovascular disease mortality decreased with increasing physical activity levels.ConclusionsThere are numerous associations between health-related behaviors and mortality outcomes after a DCIS diagnosis.Implications for cancer survivorsWomen diagnosed with DCIS should be aware that their health-related behaviors are associated with mortality outcomes.},

From the Danish Cancer Registry, we identified patients aged 30-84 years with a histologically verified first diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer between 2000 and 2013. Data on filled prescriptions, death, and potential confounding factors were obtained from nationwide registers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between post-diagnostic statin use and all-cause or ovarian cancer-specific mortality. Among 4,419 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, post-diagnostic statin use was not statistically significantly associated with all-cause (HR: 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.78-1.04) or ovarian cancer-specific mortality (HR: 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.76-1.08). There was little evidence of a dose-response relationship and the neutral associations persisted in sensitivity analyses. In women with endometrioid or clear cell tumour histology, cancer-specific mortality was reduced by 30-40\% among statin users compared to non-users, however the analyses were limited by small numbers. Significantly reduced mortality with statin use was observed in subcohorts of new users of statins and of patients not using low-dose aspirin. In conclusion, we found no strong evidence of an association between post-diagnostic statin use and reduced mortality in ovarian cancer patients. However, our finding of potential differential susceptibility to statins among patients with different histologic types of ovarian cancer warrants further evaluation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the mortality associated with atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation in the general population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area, a database that captures nearly all medical care and deaths among its 58,820 residents, we identified patients diagnosed with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation from July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1995. Patients were followed prospectively and compared with a group of controls without these arrhythmias. RESULTS: A total of 4775 person-years of follow-up were completed in 577 patients and 577 controls. Compared with controls, mortality among patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter was nearly 7.8-fold higher at 6 months (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1 to 15) and 2.5-fold higher (95\% CI: 2.0 to 3.1; P {$<$} 0.0001) at the last follow-up (mean [+/- SD] of 3.6 +/- 2.3 years; range, 1 day to 7.3 years). At 6 months, mortality among patients with atrial flutter alone was somewhat greater than in controls and less than one third that of those with atrial fibrillation (with or without atrial flutter) (P = 0.02). At the last follow-up, however, mortality was greater among patients with atrial flutter (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.2 to 2.6; P = 0.007), atrial fibrillation (HR = 2.4; 95\% CI: 1.9 to 3.1; P {$<$} 0.0001), or both atrial arrhythmias (HR = 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.9 to 3.3; P {$<$} 0.0001) when compared with controls in models that adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: In the general population, both atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation are independent predictors of increased late mortality. The relatively benign course during the 6-month period after the initial diagnosis of atrial flutter suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of these patients may improve their long-term survival.},

However, few studies analyzed the associations between obesity and long-term PC-specific outcomes after initial treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 4268 radical prostatectomy patients within the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database. Cox models accounting for known risk factors were used to examine the associations between body mass index (BMI) and PC-specific mortality (PCSM; primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included biochemical recurrence (BCR) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC). BMI was used as a continuous and categorical variable (normal {$<$}25\,kg/m2, overweight 25–29.9\,kg/m2 and obese ⩾30\,kg/m2). Median follow-up among all men who were alive at last follow-up was 6.8 years (interquartile range=3.5–11.0). During this time, 1384 men developed BCR, 117 developed CRPC and 84 died from PC. Hazard ratios were analyzed using competing-risks regression analysis accounting for non-PC death as a competing risk. Results: On crude analysis, higher BMI was not associated with risk of PCSM (P=0.112), BCR (0.259) and CRPC (P=0.277). However, when BMI was categorized, overweight (hazard ratio (HR) 1.99, P=0.034) and obesity (HR 1.97, P=0.048) were significantly associated with PCSM. Obesity and overweight were not associated with BCR or CRPC (all P⩾0.189). On multivariable analysis adjusting for both clinical and pathological features, results were little changed in that obesity (HR=2.05, P=0.039) and overweight (HR=1.88, P=0.061) were associated with higher risk of PCSM, but not with BCR or CRPC (all P⩾0.114) with the exception that the association for overweight was no longer statistical significant. Conclusions: Overweight and obesity were associated with increased risk of PCSM after radical prostatectomy. If validated in larger studies with longer follow-up, obesity may be established as a potentially modifiable risk factor for PCSM.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Observational studies suggest that statin therapy for cardio-protection is associated with improved survival in cancer patients. We sought to evaluate the impact of statin treatment on ovarian cancer survival in a nationally representative elderly population. METHODS: The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries and Medicare claims data on patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer in 2007-2009 were used to extract data on statin prescription fills, population characteristics, primary treatment, comorbidity and survival. Cox regression models were used to examine the association between statin treatment and overall survival. RESULTS: Among the 1431 ovarian cancer patients who underwent surgical resection, 609 (42.6\%) filled prescriptions for statin. The majority of statin-users (89\%) were prescribed a lipophilic formulation. Mean overall survival among statin-users was 32.3months compared to 28.8months for non-users (p{$<$}0.0001). A 34\% reduction in death was associated with statin therapy, independent of age, race, neighborhood median household income, stage, platinum therapy and comorbid conditions (HR=0.66, 95\% CI 0.55-0.81). Improved overall survival with statin use was observed for both serous (HR=0.69, 95\% CI 0.54-0.87) and non-serous (HR=0.63, 95\% CI 0.44-0.90) histologies. When statin treatment was categorized by lipophilicity and intensity, a significant survival benefit was limited to lipophilic statin users and those who took statins of moderate intensity. CONCLUSIONS: This SEER-Medicare analysis demonstrates improvement in overall survival with lipophilic statin use after surgery in elderly patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. A clinical trial to evaluate the impact of statin treatment in ovarian cancer survival is warranted.},

Participants Community-dwelling, hospitalized individuals and nursing home residents with dementia. Measurements A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of several cardiovascular diseases and risk factors on overall mortality. Results Twelve studies with 235,865 participants were included. In pooled analyses, male sex (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.67, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.56–1.78), diabetes mellitus (DM) (HR = 1.49, 95\% CI = 1.33–1.68), smoking (ever vs never) (HR = 1.37, 95\% CI = 1.17–1.61), coronary heart disease (CHD) (HR = 1.21, 95\% CI = 1.02–1.44) and congestive heart failure (CHF) (HR = 1.37, 95\% CI = 1.18–1.59) were associated with mortality. Stroke, high blood pressure, being overweight, and hypercholesterolemia were not statistically significantly related to mortality.

Design Prospective cohort study from 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2010. Setting Hospital-based cohort. Participants A nationwide hospital-based cohort of 59 201 patients with clinical diagnosis of dementia (admitted to a hospital or visiting a day clinic) was constructed (38.7\% men, 81.4 years (SD 7.0)). Main outcomes and measures 1-year and 5-year age-specific and sex-specific mortality risks were reported for patients with dementia visiting a day clinic compared with the general population; for patients hospitalised with dementia compared with patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure or stroke, these were presented as absolute and relative risks (RRs). Results 1-year mortality was 38.3\% in men and 30.5\% in women. 5-year risk was 65.4\% and 58.5\%, respectively. Mortality risks were significantly higher in patients with dementia admitted to the hospital than in those visiting a day clinic (1-year RR 3.29, 95\% CI 3.16 to 3.42; and 5-year RR 1.79, 95\% CI 1.76 to 1.83). Compared with the general population, mortality risks were significantly higher among patients visiting a day clinic (1-year RR for women 2.99, 95\% CI 2.84 to 3.14; and for men 3.94, 95\% CI 3.74 to 4.16). 5-year RRs were somewhat lower, but still significant. Results were more pronounced at younger ages. Mortality risks among admitted patients were comparable or even exceeded those of cardiovascular diseases (1-year RR for women with dementia vs AMI 1.24, 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.29; vs heart failure 1.05, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.08; vs stroke 1.07, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.10). 5-year RRs were comparable. For men, RRs were slightly higher. Conclusions Dementia has a poor prognosis as compared with other diseases and the general population. The risks among admitted patients even exceeded those following cardiovascular diseases.},

We studied this association in a prospective cohort of 15,558 patients in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2010. SES was measured using disposable household income and divided in tertiles. Overall, there was a negative relationship between SES and mortality in both sexes and both settings of care. For men who visited a day clinic, the 5-year mortality rate was 74\% among those in the lowest tertile of SES and 57\% among those in the highest; for women, the rates were 60\% and 50\%, respectively. The differences in median survival times between persons in the lower and upper tertiles of SES were 260 days for men and 300 days for women. For men who were admitted to the hospital, the 5-year mortality rate was 89\% among those in the lowest tertile of SES and 86\% among those in the highest; for women, the rates were 83\% and 77\%, respectively. The differences in median survival times between persons in the lower and upper tertiles of SES were 80 days for men and 130 days for women. Among patients who visited a day clinic, for patients in the lowest tertile of SES versus those in the highest, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.41 (95\% confidence interval: 1.26, 1.57); for those admitted to the hospital, it was 1.14 (95\% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.20). In summary, lower SES was associated with a higher mortality risk in both men and women with dementia. The results of the present study should raise awareness in clinicians and caregivers about the unfavorable prognosis in the most deprived patients.},

  abstract = {Background The risk of death in dialysis patients is high, but varies significantly among patients. No prediction tool is used widely in current clinical practice. We aimed to predict long-term mortality in incident dialysis patients using easily obtainable variables. Study Design Prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study in the United Kingdom (UK Renal Registry); models were developed using Cox proportional hazards. Setting \& Participants Patients initiating hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis therapy in 2002-2004 who survived at least 3 months on dialysis treatment were followed up for 3 years. Analyses were restricted to participants for whom information for comorbid conditions and laboratory measurements were available (n = 5,447). The data set was divided into data sets for model development (n = 3,631; training) and validation (n = 1,816) using random selection. Predictors Basic patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, and laboratory variables. Outcomes All-cause mortality censored for kidney transplant, recovery of kidney function, and loss to follow-up. Results In the training data set, 1,078 patients (29.7\%) died within the observation period. The final model for the training data set included patient characteristics (age, race, primary kidney disease, and treatment modality), comorbid conditions (diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, and smoking), and laboratory variables (hemoglobin, serum albumin, creatinine, and calcium levels); reached a C statistic of 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.73-0.77); and could discriminate accurately among patients with low (6\%), intermediate (19\%), high (33\%), and very high (59\%) mortality risk. The model was applied further to the validation data set and achieved a C statistic of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.71-0.76). Limitations Number of missing comorbidity data and lack of an external validation data set. Conclusions Basic patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, and laboratory variables can predict 3-year mortality in incident dialysis patients with sufficient accuracy. Identification of subgroups of patients according to mortality risk can guide future research and subsequently target treatment decisions in individual patients.},

A systematic literature review was done in 2012 to identify case–control studies from the past 20 years that focused on evaluating the association between screening for prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality. Emphasis was put on synthesizing the results of these studies, evaluating their limitations, and identifying remaining questions and issues that should be addressed in future studies. A total of seven studies were identified in this time period, with the majority suggesting that a reduction in prostate cancer mortality is associated with PSA screening. However, the findings may be limited by various biases inherent to case–control studies of screening tests, such as selection biases resulting from both case and control subject selection, exposure measurement issues, lead and length biases, and issues specific to prostate cancer screening such as the influence of digital rectal examinations. Findings from existing case–control studies of PSA and prostate cancer mortality suggest that there is a mortality benefit from PSA screening. However, these studies may be limited by bias and must therefore be interpreted with caution. As uncertainty regarding PSA screening remains, future studies to evaluate the association between PSA and prostate cancer mortality should address these potential biases directly.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical course of Alzheimer-type dementia and those factors that might predict or influence the length of survival. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty-six patients diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia were selected from among 200 consecutive outpatients evaluated for suspected dementia from 1980 to 1982. All 126 patients had at least 6 years of follow-up. SETTING: All patients were initially seen as outpatients at a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Survival analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox proportional hazards model. The mean age at symptom onset was 73.9 years and at enrollment in the study, 77.6 years. The median survival from time of enrollment in the study was 5.3 years (range, 0.2 to 7.2+ years) and from symptom onset, 9.3 years (range, 1.8 to 16+ years). Dementia severity, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), was strongly associated with survival (P less than 0.001); the median survival of patients with scores of 18 or below was 3 years less than that of patients with scores above 18 (relative risk, 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.6 to 4.4). Comorbid conditions and symptom duration were not related to survival. A multivariate analysis of age at symptom onset and of historical features showed that the combination of wandering and falling (relative risk, 2.1; 95\% CI, 0.9 to 5.2) and the presence of behavioral problems (relative risk, 1.4; 95\% CI, 0.7 to 2.9) at the time of evaluation appeared to adversely affect survival. CONCLUSIONS: Length of survival in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia is highly variable; severity of disease (not duration), the combination of wandering and falling, and behavioral problems are associated with shorter survival. Our findings, if confirmed, may provide prognostic information for families and professionals and suggest areas in which interventions to improve survival might be focused.},

This study evaluated the effect of obesity on the late survival of patients after aortic valve replacement (AVR) with implantation of a small aortic prosthesis (size ≤ 21 mm). METHODS: From January 1998 to December 2008, 307 patients in our institution who underwent primary AVR with smaller prostheses survived 30 days after surgery. Patients were categorized as normal weight if body mass index (BMI) was {$<$}24 kg/m(2), overweight if BMI 24-27.9 kg/m(2) and obese if BMI ≥ 28 kg/m(2). Data of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), effective orifice area index (EOAI) and left ventricular mass index of the patients were collected at the third month, sixth month, first year, third year, fifth year and eighth year after operation. RESULTS: By multivariable analysis, obesity was a significant independent factor of late mortality (hazard ratio: 1.62; P = 0.01). The obese and overweight groups of patients exhibited lower survival (P {$<$} 0.001) and a higher proportion in NYHA Class III/IV (P {$<$} 0.01) compared with the normal group. A lower EOAI and higher left ventricular mass index were found in the obese and overweight groups, but we saw no significant variance in LVEF among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with increased late mortality of patients after AVR with implantation of small aortic prosthesis. Obesity or/and overweight may also affect the NYHA classification, even in the longer term. EOAI should be improved where possible, as it may reduce late mortality and improve quality of life in obese or overweight patients.},

The Kaplan-Meier test was adopted to compare survival curves of different groups. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of marital status on overall survival (OS) and epithelial ovarian cancer-specific survival (EOCSS). To explore how marital status affected patients diagnosed at the same stage, we further performed subgroup analyses according to TNM stage. The results showed that marital status was an independent predictor for OS and EOCSS. Subgroup analyses indicated that the relationship between marital status and prognosis varied according to different conditions. Widowed patients had poorer prognosis than the other groups in most conditions, while the never married group showed similar risk of mortality as the married ones.},

Each existing REE prediction method by body composition must belong to one body composition level. The suggested classification system, founded on a conceptual basis, highlights similarities and differences among the diverse REE-body composition prediction methods, provides a framework for teaching REE-body composition relationships, and identifies important future research opportunities.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives The role of tumor size should not be neglected in the management of gastric cancer and its prognostic value needs precise reevaluation. Methods The survival data of 513 patients who underwent radical resection between 2000 and 2005 were collected retrospectively. Tumor size, measured as the maximum diameter of tumor, was categorized into four subgroups (≤2, ≤3, ≤5, {$>$}5 cm) using the method of minimizing the estimated average expected distance (AED) objective function. The prognostic value of tumor size and the correlation between tumor size and other clinicopathologic factors were investigated. Results In multivariate analysis, status of lymph nodes (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), depth of invasion (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), type of resection (P\,=\,0.004), age (P\,=\,0.008), tumor size (P\,=\,0.014), and perioperative blood transfusion (P\,=\,0.034) were confirmed as independent prognostic predictors for patients with gastric cancer. Log linear model suggested that the status of lymph nodes and the depth of invasion associated with the tumor size significantly. Conclusions The tumor size is a non-neglectable independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer and more attention should be paid to its role in the management of gastric cancer. J.

To assess the effect of smoking at diagnosis on survival, structured smoking assessments were obtained in a cohort of 5,185 cancer patients within 30 days of a cancer diagnosis between 1982 and 1998. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios were generated to analyze the effects of smoking at diagnosis on overall mortality (OM) and disease-specific mortality (DSM) in a patient cohort from 13 disease sites containing at least 100 patients in each disease site. With a minimum of 12 years of follow-up, current smoking increased OM risk versus recent quit (HR 1.17), former (HR 1.29) and never smokers (HR 1.38) in the overall cohort. Current smoking increased DSM risk versus former (HR 1.23) and never smokers (HR 1.18). In disease sites with proportionately large ({$>$}20\%) recent quit cohorts (lung and head/neck), current smoking increased OM and DSM risks as compared with recent quit. Current smoking increased mortality risks in lung, head/neck, prostate and leukemia in men and breast, ovary, uterus and melanoma in women. Current smoking was not associated with any survival benefit in any disease site. Data using prospective structured smoking assessments demonstrate that current smoking increased long-term OM and DSM. Standardized smoking assessment at diagnosis is an important variable for evaluating outcomes in cancer patients.},

Methods An inception cohort of all Olmsted County, Minnesota residents diagnosed with PMR between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1999 was compared with non-PMR subjects (two for each PMR subject) from among residents. Both cohorts were followed longitudinally by complete medical record review from the incidence date of PMR (or index date for the non-PMR cohort) until death, incident PAD, migration, or 31 December 2006. PMR-related disease characteristics, traditional cardiovascular risk factors and diagnosis of PAD were abstracted from the medical record. Cumulative incidence of PAD was estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of PAD in PMR compared with non-PMR. Results A total of 353 PMR patients (mean age 73.3 years, 67\% women) and 705 non-PMR subjects (mean age 73.2 years, 68\% female) were followed for a median of 11.0 years. PAD developed in 38 patients (10-year cumulative incidence, 8.5\%) with PMR and in 28 non-PMR subjects (10-year cumulative incidence, 4.1\%) (hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval), 2.40 (1.47, 3.92)). After adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, patients with PMR still had a significantly higher risk for PAD (hazard ratio, 2.50 (1.53, 4.08)) compared with controls. Giant cell arteritis occurred in 63 (18\%) PMR patients but was not predictive of PAD (P = 0.15). There was no difference between mortality in PMR and the non-PMR cohorts nor in PMR patients with and those without PAD (P = 0.16). Conclusions Patients with PMR appear to have an increased risk of PAD.},

  abstract = {Study objectives Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder primarily affecting the lung, but with frequent extrapulmonary organ involvement. There are no comprehensive scoring systems for sarcoidosis disease severity. Our goal was to develop and validate an objective and comprehensive sarcoidosis disease severity scoring system. Design Three sarcoidosis experts reviewed clinical data on 104 patients with biopsy-confirmed sarcoidosis. Each expert independently scored disease severity using a visual analog scale. Interrater agreement was assessed. Univariate analysis was performed, and those variables with p values ≤ 0.25 were used in backward regression multivariable analysis. A model was obtained including variables with a p value of ≤ 0.15 to predict severity scores. This model was subsequently validated using an independent panel of three additional international experts. Setting Granuloma clinic at National Jewish Medical and Research Center. Patients A total of 104 patients with biopsy-confirmed sarcoidosis. Interventions None. Measurements and results Pairwise assessment of interrater agreement yielded high degrees of correlation with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.86 to 0.89 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87. Univariate analysis showed that smoking status, immunosuppressive therapy, percent predicted for diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco), FEV1, FVC, and total lung capacity, FEV1/FVC ratio, disease duration, sites of organ involvement, and African-American race were associated with mean severity score. The multivariable model included cardiac and neurologic involvement, current therapy with noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive agents, Dlco percent predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio, African-American race, FVC percent predicted, and skin involvement. This model was validated using additional reviewer scores yielding Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.66 to 0.76 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.74. Conclusions We derived an objective disease severity scoring system that incorporates data on demographics, pulmonary function, and organ involvement to produce a whole-body sarcoidosis assessment. This preliminary tool has potential applicability in the assessment of disease severity in sarcoidosis research.},

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING US Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III: 1988–94) with follow-up of mortality to 2006. PARTICIPANTS 11,371 adults aged 20–74 participating in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, with assessment of hepatic steatosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and liver disease (up to 18 years of follow-up). RESULTS The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with and without increased levels of liver enzymes in the population was 3.1\% and 16.4\%, respectively. Compared with participants without steatosis, those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease but normal liver enzyme levels had multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for deaths from all causes of 0.92 (95\% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.09), from cardiovascular disease of 0.86 (0.67 to 1.12), from cancer of 0.92 (0.67 to 1.27), and from liver disease of 0.64 (0.12 to 3.59). Compared with participants without steatosis, those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and increased liver enzyme levels had adjusted hazard ratios for deaths from all causes of 0.80 (0.52 to 1.22), from cardiovascular disease of 0.59 (0.29 to 1.20), from cancer of 0.53 (0.26 to 1.10), and from liver disease of 1.17 (0.15 to 8.93). CONCLUSIONS Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was not associated with an increased risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or liver disease BACKGROUND \& AIMS The relative frequency of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as an indication for liver transplantation and comparative outcomes following transplantation are poorly understood. METHODS We analyzed the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for primary adult liver transplant recipients from 2001 to 2009. RESULTS From 2001 to 2009, 35,781 patients underwent a primary liver transplant, including 1959 for who NASH was the primary or secondary indication. The percentage of patients undergoing a liver transplant for NASH increased from 1.2\% in 2001 to 9.7\% in 2009. NASH is now the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. No other indication for liver transplantation increased in frequency during the study period. Compared with other indications for liver transplantation, recipients with NASH are older (58.5±8.0 vs 53.0±8.9 years; P{$<$}.001), have a larger body mass index ({$>$}30 kg/m2) (63\% vs 32\%; P{$<$}.001), are more likely to be female (47\% vs 29\%; P{$<$}.001), and have a lower frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (12\% vs 19\%; P{$<$}.001). Survival at 1 and 3 years after liver transplantation for NASH was 84\% and 78\%, respectively, compared with 87\% and 78\% for other indications (P=.67). Patient and graft survival for liver recipients with NASH were similar to values for other indications after adjusting for level of creatinine, sex, age, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS NASH is the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States and is on a trajectory to become the most common. Outcomes for patients undergoing a liver transplant for NASH are similar to those for other indications},

Incidence rates were adjusted for age and sex to the 1992 population. The prevalence of PSV in this cohort was estimated on December 31, 1997. Patients were classified according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 vasculitis criteria and the Chapel Hill Consensus definitions. Results Eighty-two NHA residents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were 47 men and 35 women, with a mean age of 62.9 years (median 65.0 years). The overall annual incidence of PSV among NHA residents was 19.8/million (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 15.8–24.6). The point prevalence on December 31, 1997 was 144.5/million (95\% CI 110.4–185.3). PSV was more common in males (23.5/million; 95\% CI 17.3–31.3) than females (16.4/million; 95\% CI 11.4–22.8). The age- and sex-specific incidence showed a clear increase with age, with an overall peak in the 65–74 year age group (60.1/million). Conclusion In our study population, the annual incidence of PSV is slowly increasing with time and the incidence is greatest in the elderly.},

The UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) contains the complete primary care records of ∼3.6 million people. There are no data on the incidence and prevalence of WG from primary care. The aim of the study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of WG in the GPRD population. Methods We identified all patients who had a first diagnosis of WG during 1990–2005, using Oxford Information System and Read codes. The diagnosis was verified by review of a randomly selected sample of 35 records that had identifying data removed. The annual incidence was calculated as the number of incident cases divided by the total person-years. Results A total of 295 patients (51.2\% male) with a first diagnosis of WG were identified during 1990–2005. The median age was 59 years (interquartile range 47–70 years). The overall annual incidence of WG was 8.4 per million (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 7.5–9.4). The annual rate in women and men was 8.1 per million (95\% CI 6.8–9.6), and 8.8 per million (95\% CI 7.4–10.3), respectively. The incidence was stable throughout the study period. There was an increase in the annual prevalence from 28.8 per million in 1990 to 64.8 per million in 2005. The diagnosis was verified in 28 of 31 available case records. Conclusion This is the first study of the incidence and prevalence of WG in a database from a primary care population. The results are similar to previous studies from secondary and tertiary care and suggest that these studies are representative of the general population. The increasing prevalence with a constant incidence suggests that survival is improving with modern treatment protocols.},

FS is of prognostic relevance for survival in different tumours. Data for patients with AML are rare. Within a prospective trial we recruited patients with newly diagnosed AML and measured FS by two different methods: Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Sixty-three patients aged 19–85 years (median 61.1) were included. Twenty-three had prior myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS), 7 favourable, 17 unfavourable karyotype. Fifty received induction chemotherapy, 13 palliative chemotherapy. Median survival was 15.2 months (95\% CI, 10.8–22.3) in all patients. Age, cytogenetic risk group, and impaired KPS and IADL significantly influenced median survival in univariate analysis. Impairment of IADL was the single most predictive variable. In multivariate analysis, impairment of IADL Score (HR:4.3, 95\% CI 1.7–10.5, P = 0.001) and of KPS (HR:4.8, 95\% CI 1.9–12.3, P = 0.001), and unfavourable cytogenetic risk group (HR:6.0, 95\% CI 2.5–14.3, P {$<$} 0.001) significantly predicted median survival. In patients with AML, FS and not age is a major predictor of survival. The influence of FS is independent from cytogenetic risk group. IADL measurement adds information to KPS. The results have to be confirmed in a large sample of patients.},

In contrast, both overweight and obesity were associated with new or progressive ADL and IADL disability in a dose-dependent manner, particularly for white men and women. Significant interactions were detected between BMI and sex but not between BMI and race for any outcome, although risk estimates for ADL disability seemed attenuated in African American relative to white respondents. Limitation: This was an observational study, baseline data were self-reported, and the study had limited power to detect differences between white and African American respondents. Conclusion: Among older U.S. adults, obesity was not associated with mortality, except for those with at least moderately severe obesity. However, lower levels of obesity were associated with new or worsening disability within 2 years. Efforts to prevent disability in older adults should target those who are overweight or obese.

We quantified the association of a broad range of chronic diseases with physical health-related qualify of life and used these weights to develop and validate a multimorbidity weighted index (MWI). Community-dwelling adults in 3 national, prospective studies-the Nurses' Health Study (n = 121,701), Nurses' Health Study II (n = 116,686), and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 51,529)-reported physician-diagnosed diseases and completed the Short Form 36 physical functioning (PF) scale over multiple survey cycles between 1992 and 2008. Mixed models were used to obtain regression coefficients for the impact of 98 morbid conditions on PF. The MWI was formed by weighting conditions by these coefficients and was validated through bootstrapping. The final sample included 612,592 observations from 216,890 participants (PF mean score = 46.5 (standard deviation, 11)). The association between diseases and PF varied severalfold (median, -1.4; range, -10.6 to 0.8). End-stage organ diseases were associated with the greatest reduction in PF. The mean MWI score was 4.8 (median, 3.7; range, 0-53), and the mean number of comorbid conditions was 3.3 (median, 2.8; range, 0-34). This validated MWI weights diseases by severity using PF, a patient-centered outcome. These results suggest that simple disease count is unlikely to capture the full impact of multimorbidity on health-related quality of life, and that the MWI is feasible and readily implemented.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem. Conflicting evidence exists among community-based studies as to whether CKD is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. After subjects with a baseline history of cardiovascular disease were excluded, data from four publicly available, community-based longitudinal studies were pooled: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Framingham Heart Study, and Framingham Offspring Study. Serum creatinine levels were indirectly calibrated across studies. CKD was defined by a GFR between 15 and 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. A composite of myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, stroke, and death was the primary study outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for study, demographic variables, educational status, and other cardiovascular risk factors. The total population included 22,634 subjects; 18.4\% of the population was black, and 7.4\% had CKD. There were 3262 events. In adjusted analyses, CKD was an independent risk factor for the composite study outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.32), and there was a significant interaction between kidney function and race. Black individuals with CKD had an adjusted HR of 1.76 (95\% CI, 1.35–2.31), whereas whites had an adjusted HR of 1.13 (95\% CI, 1.02–1.26). CKD is a risk factor for the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in the general population and a more pronounced risk factor in blacks than in whites. It is hypothesized that this effect may be due to more frequent or more severe subclinical vascular disease secondary to hypertension or diabetes in black individuals.},

  abstract = {In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the quantitation of disease severity using pulmonary function tests is often confounded by emphysema. We have identified the composite physiologic index (CPI) most closely reflecting the morphologic extent of pulmonary fibrosis. Consecutive patients with a clinical/computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 212) were divided into group I (n = 106) and group II (n = 106). The CPI was derived in group I (by fitting pulmonary function tests against disease extent on CT) and was tested in Group II. The formula for the CPI was as follows: extent of disease on CT = 91.0 − (0.65 × percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) − (0.53 × percent predicted FVC) + (0.34 × percent predicted FEV1). In group II, the CPI correlated more strongly with disease extent on CT (r2 = 0.51) than the individual pulmonary function test (DLCO the highest value, r2 = 0.38). A subanalysis demonstrated that the better fit of the CPI was ascribable to a correction of the confounding effects of emphysema. Mortality was predicted more accurately by the CPI than by a pulmonary function test in all clinical subgroups, including a separate cohort of 36 patients with histologically proven usual interstitial pneumonia (CPI, p {$<$} 0.0005; FVC, p = 0.002; PO2, p = 0.002). In conclusion, a new CPI, derived against CT and validated using split sample testing, is a more accurate prognostic determinant in usual interstitial pneumonia than an individual pulmonary function test.},

  abstract = {Introduction. The objective of this study was to create a tool that accurately predicts the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes according to an oral hypoglycemic agent. Materials and Methods. The model was based on a cohort of 33,067 patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed a single oral hypoglycemic agent at the Cleveland Clinic between 1998 and 2006. Competing risk regression models were created for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and stroke, while a Cox regression model was created for mortality. Propensity scores were used to account for possible treatment bias. A prediction tool was created and internally validated using tenfold cross-validation. The results were compared to a Framingham model and a model based on the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) for CHD and stroke, respectively. Results and Discussion. Median follow-up for the mortality outcome was 769 days. The numbers of patients experiencing events were as follows: CHD (3062), heart failure (1408), stroke (1451), and mortality (3661). The prediction tools demonstrated the following concordance indices (c-statistics) for the specific outcomes: CHD (0.730), heart failure (0.753), stroke (0.688), and mortality (0.719). The prediction tool was superior to the Framingham model at predicting CHD and was at least as accurate as the UKPDS model at predicting stroke. Conclusions. We created an accurate tool for predicting the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and death in patients with type 2 diabetes. The calculator is available online at http://rcalc.ccf.org under the heading "Type 2 Diabetes" and entitled, "Predicting 5-Year Morbidity and Mortality." This may be a valuable tool to aid the clinician's choice of an oral hypoglycemic, to better inform patients, and to motivate dialogue between physician and patient.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study was designed to compare the long-term outcomes of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with a risk factor matched population of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, but without PAD. Background The PAD is considered to be a risk factor for adverse late outcome. Methods A total of 2,730 PAD patients undergoing vascular surgery were categorized into groups: 1) carotid endarterectomy (n = 560); 2) elective abdominal aortic surgery (AAA) (n = 923); 3) acute AAA surgery (r-AAA) (n = 200), and 4) lower limb reconstruction procedures (n = 1,047). All patients were matched using the propensity score, with 2,730 CAD patients who underwent coronary angioplasty. Survival status of all patients was obtained. In addition, the cause of death and complications after surgery in PAD patients were noted. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare survival between the matched PAD and CAD population and the different operation groups. Prognostic risk factors and perioperative complications were identified with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results The PAD patients had a worse long-term prognosis (hazard ratio 2.40, 95\% confidence interval 2.18 to 2.65) and received less medication (beta-blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, nitrates, and calcium antagonists) than CAD patients did (p {$<$} 0.001). Cerebro-cardiovascular complications were the major cause of long-term death (46\%). Importantly, no significant difference in long-term survival was observed between the AAA and lower limb reconstruction groups (log rank p = 0.70). After vascular surgery, perioperative cardiac complications were associated with long-term cardiac death, and noncardiac complications were associated with all-cause death. Conclusions Long-term prognosis of vascular surgery patients is significantly worse than for patients with CAD. The vascular surgery patients receive less cardiac medication than CAD patients do, and cerebro-cardiovascular events are the major cause of late death.},

METHODS: Based on Beijing's dementia prevalence survey among residents aged 55 years and above in 1997, respondents were selected by stratified multiple-stage cluster sampling and 12 urban communities and 17 rural village communities were randomly sampled then follow-up in 2001. COX regression was used to analyze relative risks controlling confounding factors on deaths of dementia cases. RESULTS: The mortality of dement patients in the 55-64 age-group was 0.82/100 person-year. The age-standardized mortality of dement cases was 0.90/100 person-year. The mortality in the 65 and above age-group was 1.44/100 person-year, and the age-standardized mortality was 1.56/100 person-year. Among AD cases, the above two mortalities were 0.35/100 and 0.42/100 person-year respectively, and among VaD cases, 0.34/100 and 0.36/100 person-year respectively. For both AD and VaD cases, their mortality increased with age. Region, gender and age were more significant to survival of AD cases. CONCLUSION: One major subtype of dementia, AD, among elderly urban and rural residents in Beijing, has a different mortality and epidemiological pattern from VaD.},

Cardiomyopathies represent a heterogeneous group of diseases that often lead to progressive heart failure with significant morbidity and mortality.

Major types include dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Although cardiomyopathy is asymptomatic in the early stages, symptoms are the same as those characteristically seen in any type of heart failure and may include shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and edema. Diagnostic studies include B-type natriuretic peptide levels, baseline serum chemistries, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Treatment is targeted at relieving the symptoms of heart failure and reducing rates of heart failure-related hospitalization and mortality. Treatment options include pharmacotherapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and heart transplantation. Recommended lifestyle changes include restricting alcohol consumption, losing weight, exercising, quitting smoking, and eating a low-sodium diet.},

The Rai and Binet staging systems have been used to risk-stratify patients; most patients present with early-stage disease. We evaluated a group of previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at initial presentation to University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center to identify independent characteristics that predict for overall survival. Clinical and routine laboratory characteristics for 1674 previously untreated patients who presented for evaluation of CLL from 1981 to 2004 were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified several patient characteristics at presentation that predicted for overall survival in previously untreated patients with CLL. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was developed, including the following independent characteristics: age, β-2 microglobulin, absolute lymphocyte count, sex, Rai stage, and number of involved lymph node groups. Inclusion of patients from a single institution and the proportion of patients younger than 65 years may limit this model. A weighted prognostic model, or nomogram, predictive for overall survival was constructed using these 6 characteristics for 5- and 10-year survival probability and estimated median survival time. This prognostic model may help patients and clinicians in clinical decision making as well as in clinical research and clinical trial design.},

It is important to recognize that BR coexistent with RA differs from the other types of BR. The purpose of this descriptive review was to delineate the epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, pulmonary function testing, imaging, prognosis and management of concomitant BR and RA. To inform our study we searched the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and MEDLINE databases, using combinations of the following key words: computed tomography, lung function tests, rheumatoid arthritis, bronchiectasis, biological agents, and interstitial lung disease. The number of published papers covering this topic is limited, but several relevant conclusions can be drawn. Patients with concomitant RA and BR have worse obstructive airways disease, increased susceptibility to recurrent pulmonary infections, faster lung function decline, and higher mortality, compared with subjects with either RA or BR alone. The use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (both biological and non-biological) for RA in RA-BR patients imparts a further challenge in managing these patients. Although there are not any published guidelines on the management of coexisting RA-BR, we have attempted to provide such recommendations, based on the literature review and our experience.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study on mortality from cancer among workers of an asbestos plant manufacturing asbestos yarn, cloth, cords, packings, stuffing, brake linings and asbestos-rubber sheets was launched in the 1980s. The present paper discusses the results of further tracing of asbestos workers of the same plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort covered 4497 workers employed at the asbestos plant in 1945-1980. The follow-up of the cohort continued until 31 December 1999. Deaths by causes were analyzed using standardized mortality ratio (SMR) calculated by the person-years method. The mortality pattern of the general population of Poland was used as reference. RESULTS: The availability of the cohort was 93.1\% (2805 men and 1382 women were traced). Mortality from malignant neoplasms in total (281 deaths among men, SMR = 118, 95\%CI: 105-133 and 135 deaths among women, SMR = 159, 95\%CI: 133-188) as well as that from lung cancer (102 deaths among men, SMR = 126, 95\%CI: 103-153 and 18 deaths among women, SMR = 259, 95\%CI: 153-409) were significantly higher than in the general population. Unlike earlier stages of analysis, the present study revealed an increased risk of pleural mesothelioma (2 deaths among men, SMR = 510, 95\%CI: 62-1842 and 3 deaths among women, SMR = 2033, 95\%CI: 419-5941). Mortality analysis among workers with asbestosis and in those without diagnosed asbestosis, did not reveal direct association between the risk of asbestos-induced lung cancer and previously diagnosed asbestosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged cohort tracing showed an increased risk of asbestos-related cancers. It concerned mainly workers hired by the plant between 1945-1955, when the working condition were most strenuous.},

The CamPaIGN study has been the first to prospectively track disease evolution from diagnosis in an unselected population-representative incident cohort. We now report the 10-year follow-up data, focusing on three key irreversible milestones: postural instability (Hoehn and Yahr 3), dementia and death. Methods The cohort was collected between December 2000 and 2002. Those meeting diagnostic criteria (n=142) were followed-up until 1 January 2012. Clinical, neuropsychological and genetic testing were performed. Progression to key milestones was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression survival analyses. Results At 10 years, 55\% had died, 68\% had postural instability and 46\% dementia. 23\% had a good outcome at 10 years (surviving free of dementia/postural instability). Death rate was comparable with the UK population (standardised mortality ratio 1.29 (0.97–1.61)). Death certificates indicated PD was a substantial contributor in only 20\%, with pneumonia being the commonest cause of death. Age, non-tremor-dominant motor phenotype and comorbidity predicted earlier postural instability. Baseline predictors of dementia were age, motor impairment, ‘posterior-cortical’ cognitive deficits and MAPT genotype. Conclusions (1) outlook in PD is heterogeneous, with most dying or developing dementia or postural instability by 10 years from diagnosis, but a quarter still doing well, with preserved mobility and intact cognition; (2) death is not directly related to PD in the majority; (3) baseline clinical and genetic variables are predictive of outcome and may be helpful in selecting patients for clinical trials.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Poststroke depression has been linked to higher mortality after stroke. However, the effect of other mental health conditions on poststroke mortality has not been examined. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of poststroke depression and other mental health diagnoses on mortality after ischemic stroke. METHOD: The authors examined a national cohort of veterans hospitalized after an ischemic stroke at any U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center from 1990 to 1998. Demographic, admission, and all-cause mortality data were abstracted from VA administrative databases. Chronic conditions present at discharge and new poststroke depression and other mental health diagnoses within 3 years after the stroke were identified with ICD-9 codes. Mortality hazard ratios were modeled by using Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 51,119 patients hospitalized after an ischemic stroke who survived beyond 30 days afterward were identified; 2,405 (5\%) received a diagnosis of depression, and 2,257 (4\%) received another mental health diagnosis within 3 years of their stroke. Patients with poststroke depression were younger, more often white, and less likely to be alive at the end of the 3-year follow-up period. Both poststroke depression (hazard ratio=1.13, 95\% CI=1.06–1.21) and other mental health diagnoses (hazard ratio=1.13, 95\% CI=1.07–1.22) independently increased the hazard for death even after other chronic conditions were controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being younger and having fewer chronic conditions, a higher 3-year mortality risk was seen in patients with poststroke depression and other mental health diagnoses after hospitalization for an ischemic stroke. The biological and psychosocial mechanisms driving this greater risk should be further explored, and the effect of depression treatment on mortality after stroke should be tested.},

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate the utilization of neurologist providers in the treatment of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) in the United States and determine whether neurologist treatment is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with PD in the year 2002. Multilevel logistic regression was used to determine which patient characteristics predicted neurologist care between 2002 and 2005 and compare the age, race, sex, and comorbidity-adjusted annual risk of skilled nursing facility placement and hip fracture between neurologist- and primary care physician–treated patients with PD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the adjusted 6-year risk of death using incident PD cases, stratified by physician specialty. Results: More than 138,000 incident PD cases were identified. Only 58\% of patients with PD received neurologist care between 2002 and 2005. Race and sex were significant demographic predictors of neurologist treatment: women (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–0.80) and nonwhites (OR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.79–0.87) were less likely to be treated by a neurologist. Neurologist-treated patients were less likely to be placed in a skilled nursing facility (OR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.77–0.82) and had a lower risk of hip fracture (OR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.80–0.92) in logistic regression models that included demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic covariates. Neurologist-treated patients also had a lower adjusted likelihood of death (hazard ratio 0.78, 95\% CI 0.77–0.79). Conclusions: Women and minorities with PD obtain specialist care less often than white men. Neurologist care of patients with PD may be associated with improved selected clinical outcomes and greater survival.},

Design Retrospective cohort study of 138,000 Medicare beneficiaries with incident PD were identified in 2002 and followed through 2008. Main Outcome Measures Confounder adjusted six year risk of death as influenced by three groups of factors: 1) race, sex, age at diagnosis 2) geography, environmental factors 3) clinical conditions. We examined hospitalization diagnoses in terminal PD, compared PD mortality to that of other common diseases. Results Thirty-five percent of PD cases lived more than six years. Sex and race significantly predicted survival: female (HR 0.74, 0.73– 0.75), Hispanic (HR 0.72, 0.65–0.80) and Asian (HR 0.86, 0.82–0.91) cases had a lower adjusted risk of death than white males. Dementia/cognitive impairment, diagnosed in 69.6\% of cases, most often in Blacks (78.2\%) and women (71.5\%), was associated with a greater likelihood of death (HR 1.72, 1.69–1.75). PD cases had greater mortality than many common life threatening diseases. Terminal PD patients were hospitalized frequently for cardiovascular disease (15.06\%) and infection (29.52\%), rarely for PD related illness (4.2\%). Regional survival rates were similar, but urban PD cases living in a high industrial metal emission area had a slightly higher adjusted risk of death (HR 1.19, 1.10–1.29). Conclusions Demographic and clinical factors impact PD survival. Dementia is highly prevalent in PD and is associated with a significant increase in mortality. More research is needed to understand if environmental exposures influence PD course or survival.},

The hazard ratio estimates were incorporated into Predict. The validation study was based on 1653 patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer identified from the British Columbia Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit. Predicted overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) for Predict+, Predict and Adjuvant! were compared with observed outcomes. Results: All three models performed well for both OS and BCSS. Both Predict models provided better BCSS estimates than Adjuvant!. In the subset of patients with HER2-positive tumours, Predict+ performed substantially better than the other two models for both OS and BCSS. Conclusion: Predict+ is the first clinical breast cancer prognostication tool that includes tumour HER2 status.

The characteristics and richness of the data are such that the GPRD is likely to prove a key data resource for the proactive pharmacovigilance anticipated in risk management and pharmacovigilance plans.An update of recent developments to the database and new data available from it — including spontaneously recorded suspected adverse drug reactions — is presented in the article, with a description of how the data can be used to support a variety of pharmacovigilance applications. The possibility of using the GPRD in signal detection and assessment of the impact of pharmacovigilance activities in the future is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective To improve equity in cardiovascular disease prevention by developing a cardiovascular risk score including social deprivation and family history. Design The ASSIGN score was derived from cardiovascular outcomes in the Scottish Heart Health Extended Cohort (SHHEC). It was tested against the Framingham cardiovascular risk score in the same database. Setting Random-sample, risk-factor population surveys across Scotland 1984-87, North Glasgow 1989, 1992 and 1995. Participants 6540 men and 6757 women aged 30-74, initially free of cardiovascular disease; ranked for social deprivation by postcode of residence using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), followed for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity through 2005. Results Classic risk factors, including cigarette dosage, plus deprivation and family history, but not obesity were significant factors in constructing ASSIGN scores for each sex. ASSIGN scores, lower on average, correlated closely with the Framingham values for ten-year cardiovascular risk. Discrimination of risk in the SHHEC population was significantly, but marginally improved overall by ASSIGN. However, the social gradient in cardiovascular event rates was inadequately reflected by the Framingham score, leaving a large social disparity in future victims not identified as high risk. ASSIGN classified more people with social deprivation and positive family history as high-risk, anticipated more of their events, and abolished this gradient. Conclusion Conventional cardiovascular scores fail to target social gradients in disease. By including unattributed risk from deprivation ASSIGN shifts preventive treatment towards the socially deprived. Family history is valuable not least as an approach to ethnic susceptibility. ASSIGN merits further evaluation for clinical use},

The relevant literature was retrieved on a keyword basis from online medical and official death statistics databases. Fifteen European and North American studies were analyzed, for comparison with the results reported in review papers. The 1990s incidence and mortality rates of MND average at 1.89 per 100,000/year and 1.91 per 100,000/year, respectively, thus yielding increases of 46\% and 57\% over the 1960s-1970s decades, respectively. This increase appears mainly due to Southern Europe countries, to female gender and to patients aged 75 years and over.Thus, the results of this analysis (i) confirm that the incidence of, and mortality from, MNDs continued to increase during the 1990s and, (ii) suggest that this increase could be partly due to increased life expectancy. Other factors might also contribute, such as better diagnosis since El Escorial criteria, and better accuracy of death certificate collection.However, a real increase in the incidence of MNDs, possibly related to environmental factors, cannot be excluded.},

These findings have not been explored for PCa-specific mortality (PCSM). In this population-based cohort, we determine PCa outcomes at different Gleason scores, in particular the different Gleason 7 patterns. Methods Men aged 40–64 diagnosed with PCa between 1993–1996 in King County, Washington comprised the cohort. Recurrence/progression was determined by follow-up survey and medical records review. Mortality and cause of death were obtained from the SEER registry. Outcomes were determined with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results Of 753 men with PCa, 65 PCa-specific deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 13.2 years. The 10-year PCa-specific survival rates for Gleason ≤6, 3+4, 4+3, and 8–10 were 98.4\%, 92.1\%, 76.5\% and 69.9\%, respectively. Compared to patients with Gleason 3+4 disease, those with Gleason 4+3 tumors had an increased risk of PCSM in both the unadjusted (HR 2.80, 95\%CI 1.26 – 6.18) and multivariate models (HR 2.12, 95\% CI 0.87–5.17, p=0.1). In men undergoing curative therapy with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, there was an increased risk of recurrence/progression (HR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.1–4.0) and PCSM (HR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.0–9.7) in those with Gleason 4+3 compared to 3+4 tumors in the multivariate models. No difference in PCSM was seen between Gleason 4+3 and 8 – 10 tumors. Conclusion Gleason 7 PCa tumors exhibit a heterogeneous behavior with Gleason 3+4 and 4+3 tumors conferring different PCSM. These data provide important information for counseling patients with Gleason 7 PCa on the natural history of their disease and may inform treatment decisions.},

  abstract = {Background The role of comorbidities in survival of breast cancer patients has not been well studied, particularly in non-white populations. Methods We investigated the association of specific comorbidities with mortality in a multiethnic cohort of 8,952 breast cancer cases within the California Breast Cancer Survivorship Consortium (CBCSC), which pooled questionnaire and cancer registry data from five California-based studies. In total, 2,187 deaths (1,122 from breast cancer) were observed through December 31, 2010. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated hazards ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for overall and breast cancer-specific mortality associated with previous cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure (HBP), and myocardial infarction (MI). Results Risk of breast cancer-specific mortality increased among breast cancer cases with a history of diabetes (HR=1.48, 95\% CI=1.18, 1.87) or MI (HR=1.94, 95\% CI=1.27–2.97). Risk patterns were similar across race/ethnicity (non-Latina White, Latina, African American and Asian American), body size, menopausal status, and stage at diagnosis. In subgroup analyses, risk of breast cancer-specific mortality was significantly elevated among cases with diabetes who received neither radiation nor chemotherapy (HR=2.11, 95\% CI=1.32–3.36); no increased risk was observed among those who received both treatments (HR=1.13, 95\% CI= 0.70–1.84) (P interaction= 0.03). A similar pattern was found for MI by radiation and chemotherapy (P interaction=0.09). Conclusion These results may inform future treatment guidelines for breast cancer patients with a history of diabetes or MI. Impact Given the growing number of breast cancer survivors worldwide, we need to better understand how comorbidities may adversely affect treatment decisions and ultimately outcome.},

Patients were traced back to determine the presence of premotor symptoms, including rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, and constipation. Cox’s regression analysis was used to detect the risks between the occurrence of premotor symptoms and the outcome (including death, psychosis, accidental injury, dementia and aspiration pneumonia). In addition, the association between premotor symptoms and levodopa equivalent dosage (LED) was examined. Results Higher occurrence of death, dementia and aspiration pneumonia were identified in PD patients with premotor symptoms than without premotor symptoms (HR 1·69, 95\% CI 1·34–2·14, p {$<$}0·001 for death; HR 1·63, 95\% CI 1·20–2·22, p = 0·002 for dementia; HR 2·45, 95\% CI 1·42–4·21, p = 0·001 for aspiration pneumonia). In a comorbidities-stratified analysis, PD patients with premotor symptoms showed significantly high risks of mortality and morbidity (dementia and aspiration pneumonia), especially in the absence of comorbidities. Independent predictors of mortality in PD were found to be higher age, male sex, constipation, RBD, RBD with constipation and depression, and diabetes. Furthermore, no significant differences of LED and subsequent accidental injury were noted between PD patient with or without premotor symptoms. Conclusion Premotor symptoms seem to be not merely risk factors, but also prognostic factors of PD.},

  abstract = {Background \& Hypothesis: The study aims to develop a risk index to predict all cause mortality for a cohort of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients seen at primary care clinics in Singapore. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, 28 patient-level variables were extracted from an automated clinical and administrative registry (CMDR) for T2DM who had at least 2 visits to the same National Healthcare Group Polyclinic in 2007. Demographic characteristics, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, laboratory results, and prescription, were included. Mortality data were provided by the Ministry of Health. We used a split-sample design to derive and validate an index to predict the risk of death within 2 years of the index attendance. The C-statistic was used to assess model discrimination. Results: Out of the 59,747 patients in the study, 2,977 (5\%) patients died during the 2-year follow up. Age (“A”); diabetes-related complications (Diabetes Complication Severity Index) (“C”); and cancer history (“C”) were found to independently predict all-cause mortality (from which the mnemonic “ACC” was derived). The ACC risk index ranged from 0 to 23 with expected risk of mortality of 0.3\% to 86.9\%. The discriminatory accuracy of the ACC risk index for the validation data is excellent (C statistic 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.82 to 0.84). Discussion \& Conclusion: A simple risk index for all-cause mortality was successfully developed, and validated using routinely collected registry data. The risk index can be used to stratify T2 DM patients into varying risk of mortality. Further external validation of the risk index is needed before using it in a clinical setting.},

Recurrences frequently occur and continued surveillance is necessary to identify and treat recurrent tumors. Efforts to identify risk factors that are potentially modifiable to reduce the rate of recurrence are needed. Methods We investigated cigarette smoking behavior and body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis for associations with bladder cancer recurrence in a population-based study of 726 bladder cancer patients in New Hampshire, US. Patients diagnosed with non-muscle invasive urothelial-cell carcinoma were followed to ascertain long-term prognosis. Analysis of time to recurrence was performed using multivariate Cox regression models. Results Smokers experienced shorter time to recurrence (continuing smoker HR 1.51 95\%CI 1.08-2.13). Although being overweight (BMI{$>$}24.9 kg/m2) at diagnosis was not a strong independent factor (HR 1.33 95\%CI 0.94-1.89), among continuing smokers, being overweight more than doubled the risk of recurrence compared to smokers of normal weight (HR 2.67 95\%CI 1.14-6.28). Conclusions These observational results suggest that adiposity is a risk factor for bladder cancer recurrence, particularly among tobacco users. Future intervention studies are warranted to evaluate whether both smoking cessation and weight reduction strategies reduce bladder tumor recurrences.},

Design Analysis of participants from prospective population based cohort study in 1991-2003, with follow-up of dementia status in all individuals after two and six years (in one centre) and 10 years and in subsamples additionally at six and eight years and mortality until 2005. Setting Multicentre population based study in England and Wales: two rural and three urban centres. Participants 438 participants who developed dementia from a population based study of 13 004 individuals aged 65 years and over drawn from primary care population registers. Main outcome measures Sociodemographic factors, cognitive function, specific health conditions, and self reported health collected at each interview. Cox’s proportional hazards regression models were used to identify predictors of mortality from the selected variables in people who received diagnosis of dementia according the study’s criteria. Results By December 2005, 356 of the 438 (81\%) participants who developed dementia during the study had died. Estimated median survival time from onset of dementia to death was 4.1 years (interquartile range 2.5-7.6) for men and 4.6 years (2.9-7.0) for women. There was a difference of nearly seven years in survival between the younger old and the oldest people with dementia: 10.7 (25th centile 5.6) for ages 65-69; 5.4 (interquartile range 3.4-8.3) for ages 70-79; 4.3 (2.8-7.0) for ages 80-89, and 3.8 (2.3-5.2) years for ages ≥90. Significant factors that predicted mortality in the presence of dementia during the follow-up included sex, age of onset, and disability. Conclusion These analyses give a population based estimated median survival for incident dementia of 4.5 years. Such estimates can be used for prognosis and planning for patients, carers, service providers, and policy makers.},

  abstract = {In cancer genomics, gene expression levels provide important molecular signatures for all types of cancer, and this could be very useful for predicting the survival of cancer patients. However, the main challenge of gene expression data analysis is high dimensionality, and microarray is characterised by few number of samples with large number of genes. To overcome this problem, a variety of penalised Cox proportional hazard models have been proposed. We introduce a novel network regularised Cox proportional hazard model and a novel multiplex network model to measure the disease comorbidities and to predict survival of the cancer patient. Our methods are applied to analyse seven microarray cancer gene expression datasets: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer and osteosarcoma. Firstly, we applied a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of original gene expression data. Secondly, we applied a network regularised Cox regression model on the reduced gene expression datasets. By using normalised mutual information method and multiplex network model, we predict the comorbidities for the liver cancer based on the integration of diverse set of omics and clinical data, and we find the diseasome associations (disease-gene association) among different cancers based on the identified common significant genes. Finally, we evaluated the precision of the approach with respect to the accuracy of survival prediction using ROC curves. We report that colon cancer, liver cancer and renal cancer share the CXCL5 gene, and breast cancer, ovarian cancer and renal cancer share the CCND2 gene. Our methods are useful to predict survival of the patient and disease comorbidities more accurately and helpful for improvement of the care of patients with comorbidity.

  abstract = {The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS) has emerged as a useful predictor of long-term outcome in NAFLD patients. We evaluated the predictive performance of the NFS for overall mortality in a Chinese population with NAFLD. All NAFLD patients diagnosed ultrasonographically at Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou between 1996 and 2011 were retrospectively recruited to the study. Outcome was determined by interview and causes of death were confirmed by medical records. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) was used to determine the predictive accuracy of the NFS, BARD (body mass index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, diabetes) score, FIB-4 index and the AST/platelet ratio index (APRI) for mortality. Data from a total of 180 eligible patients (median age 39 years; 96 men) were analysed, with 12 deaths over a median follow-up period of 6.6 years (range 0.5–14.8 years). Using Cox model analysis, the NFS as a continuous variable was identified as the only predictor for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.743, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.670–4.504). The NFS yielded the highest AUCROC of 0.828 (95\% CI 0.728–0.928, P {$<$} 0.05), followed by the FIB-4 index, APRI and BARD score (AUCROC 0.806 (P {$<$} 0.05), 0.732 (P {$<$} 0.05) and 0.632, respectively). The data indicated that the NFS is a useful predictor of 6.6-year all-cause mortality for Chinese patients with NAFLD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES:~Population-based data on chronic pancreatitis (CP) in the United States are scarce. We determined incidence, prevalence, and survival of CP in Olmsted County, MN.         METHODS:~Using Mayo Clinic Rochester's Medical Diagnostic Index followed by a detailed chart review, we identified 106 incident CP cases from 1977 to 2006 (89 clinical cases, 17 diagnosed only at autopsy); CP was defined by previously published Mayo Clinic criteria. We calculated age- and sex-adjusted incidence (for each decade) and prevalence rate (1 January 2006) per 100,000 population (adjusted to 2000 US White population). We compared the observed survival rate for patients with expected survival for age- and sex-matched Minnesota White population.         RESULTS:~Median age at diagnosis of CP was 58 years, 56\% were male, and 51\% had alcoholic CP. The overall (clinical cases or diagnosed only at autopsy) age- and sex-adjusted incidence was 4.05/100,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.27–4.83). The incidence rate for clinical cases increased significantly from 2.94/100,000 during 1977–1986 to 4.35/100,000 person-years during 1997–2006 (P{$<$}0.05) because of an increase in the incidence of alcoholic CP. There were 51 prevalent CP cases on 1 January 2006 (57\% male, 53\% alcoholic). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rate per 100,000 population was 41.76 (95\% CI 30.21–53.32). At last follow-up, 50 patients were alive. Survival among CP patients was significantly lower than age- and sex-specific expected survival in Minnesota White population (P{$<$}0.001).         CONCLUSIONS:~Incidence and prevalence of CP are low, and ∼50\% are alcohol related. The incidence of CP cases diagnosed during life is increasing. Survival of CP patients is lower than in the Minnesota White population.},

  abstract = {The "obesity paradox" that patients with high body mass index (BMI) have good prognoses remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the impact of BMI on clinical outcomes in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Data from the French national TAVI registry were collected for 3,072 patients who underwent TAVI from January 2010 to October 2011. The patients were categorized into 4 groups according to BMI (kg/m(2)): underweight ({$<$}18.5 kg/m(2)), normal weight (18.5 to 25 kg/m(2)), overweight (25~to 30 kg/m(2)), and obese ({$>$}30 kg/m(2)). Thereafter, clinical outcomes were compared among the 4 groups. The BMI distribution was 3.1\% (n~= 95), 44.1\% (n~= 1,355), 34.2\% (n~= 1,050), and 18.6\% (n~= 572). Although the 4 groups greatly differed in baseline clinical background, they had similar procedural success rates (95.8\%, 97.1\%, 97.3\%, and 95.6\%, p~= 0.23). Major vascular complication was significantly associated with the underweight patients after adjusting for the other potential confounders (odds ratio 2.33, 95\% confidence interval 1.17 to 4.46, p~= 0.016). The cumulative postoperative survival rates were increasing across the 4 groups at 30~days (83.2\%, 88.9\%, 91.6\%, and 93.0\%, p~= 0.003) and 1~year (67.9\%, 73.6\%, 77.4\%, and 80.3\%, p~= 0.006). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, the overweight and obese patients were independently associated with superior cumulative survival rate at 1~year (hazard ratios 0.74 and 0.71, 95\% confidence intervals 0.57 to 0.97 and 0.59 to 0.87, p~= 0.050 and 0.029, respectively).

However, the association between BMI and all-cause mortality for hypertensive Chinese adults remains unclear. We conducted a post-hoc analysis using data from the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT). Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the significance of the association of BMI with all-cause mortality. During a mean follow-up duration of 4.5 years, 622 deaths (3.0\%) occurred among the 20,694 participants aged 45–75 years. A reversed J-shaped relationship was observed between BMI and all-cause mortality. The hazard ratios (HRs) for underweight ({$<$}18.5 kg/m2), overweight (24.0–27.9 kg/m2), and obesity (≥28.0 kg/m2) were calculated relative to normal weight (18.5–23.9 kg/m2). The summary HRs were 1.56 (95\% CI, 1.11–2.18) for underweight, 0.78 (95\% CI 0.64–0.95) for overweight and 0.64 (95\% CI, 0.48–0.85) for obesity. In sex-age-specific analyses, participants over 60 years of age had optimal BMI in the obesity classification and the results were consistent in both males and females. Relative to normal weight, underweight was associated with significantly higher mortality. Excessive weight was not associated with increased risk of mortality. Chinese hypertensive adults had the lowest mortality in grade 1 obesity.},

Substantial uncertainty remains about the relationship in populations with lower mean BMI levels, and about the relevance to it of the effects of smoking or of reverse causality.Methods A nationally representative prospective cohort study included 221 194 Chinese men aged 40–79 years in 1990–91, who were followed up for 15 years or to the age of 80 years. Hazard ratios for COPD-related mortality vs baseline BMI were adjusted for age, smoking, drinking and other factors. To reduce reverse causality, main analyses excluded all men with prior history of any respiratory diseases or abnormal lung function at baseline, leaving 2960 COPD-related deaths (16\% of all deaths).Results The mean baseline BMI was 21.7 kg/m2. There was a highly significant inverse association between BMI and COPD-related mortality among men without any apparent impairment of lung function. Approximately 90\% of men had a baseline BMI \&lt;25 kg/m2, and among them, 5 kg/m2 lower BMI was associated with 31\% (95\% confidence interval 18–45\%) higher COPD-related mortality. The excess risk persisted after restricting the analysis to never-smokers or excluding the first 5 years of follow-up.Conclusions Low BMI is associated with increased COPD mortality in a relatively lean adult male population in China where COPD is one of the most common causes of death.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the causes of the changes in the rates of mortality and select severe complications of diabetes mellitus, type 2 (T2D) among the elderly between 1992 and 2012. RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study design based on Medicare 5\% administrative claims data from 1992 to 2012 was used. Traditional fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and older, diagnosed with T2D and living in the United States between 1992 and 2012 were included in the study. Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition was used to quantify the potential causes of the change in the rates of death, congestive heart failure and/or acute myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation of lower extremity and end-stage renal disease between 1992 and 2012. RESULTS: The number of beneficiaries in the analysis sample diagnosed with T2D increased from 152,191 in 1992 to 289,443 in 2012. Over the same time period, rates of mortality decreased by 1.2, congestive heart failure and/or acute myocardial infarction by 2.6, stroke by 1.6, amputation by 0.6 while rates of end-stage renal disease increased by 1.5 percentage points. Improvements in the management of precursor conditions and utilization of recommended healthcare services, not population composition, were the primary causes of the change. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of end-stage renal disease, outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with T2D improved. Analysis suggests that persons diagnosed with T2D are living longer with fewer severe complications. Much of the improvement in outcomes likely reflects more regular contact with health professionals and better management of care.},

  abstract = {Objectives This meta-analysis aims to investigate the possibility of bone mineral loss and fracture in sarcoidosis. Materials and methods A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases was performed from inception through August 2017. The inclusion criterion was observational studies evaluating the association between sarcoidosis and bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of fracture, standardized mean difference (SMD) of volumetric BMD and areal BMD, and their 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis to compare risk between sarcoidosis and controls. The between-study heterogeneity of effect-size was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results Data were extracted from 10 studies involving a total of 6,448 sarcoidosis patients and 77,857 controls. The pooled result demonstrated no significant increased risk of fracture in sarcoidosis patients compared with controls (OR=1.68; 95\% CI: 0.85-3.31, p value=0.14, I2=72\%). There were no differences between the patients and controls in areal BMD (SMD= 0.21 g/cm2; 95\% CI: -0.12-0.54, p value= 0.22, I2=0\%) or volumetric BMD (SMD= 0.04 mg/cm3; 95\% CI: -0.51-0.58, p value=0.89, I2=83\%). Conclusion Our study has not shown an increased risk of fracture or bone mineral loss in sarcoidosis. However, based on the currently available studies with heterogeneity in between, the conclusion for the osteoporosis screening and fracture risk assessment of patients with sarcoidosis cannot be drawn until more studies are available.},

SDB is linked to incident cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other morbidity. However, the risk of mortality with untreated SDB, determined by polysomnography screening, in the general population has not been established. METHODS: An 18-year mortality follow-up was conducted on the population-based Wisconsin Sleep Cohort sample (n = 1522), assessed at baseline for SDB with polysomnography, the clinical diagnostic standard. SDB was described by the number of apnea and hypopnea episodes/hour of sleep; cutpoints at 5, 15 and 30 identified mild, moderate, and severe SDB, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks, adjusted for potential confounding factors, associated with SDB severity levels. RESULTS: All-cause mortality risk, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and other factors was significantly increased with SDB severity. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR, 95\% CI) for all-cause mortality with severe versus no SDB was 3.0 (1.4,6.3). After excluding persons who had used CPAP treatment (n = 126), the adjusted HR (95\% CI) for all-cause mortality with severe versus no SDB was 3.8 (1.6,9.0); the adjusted HR (95\% CI) for cardiovascular mortality was 5.2 (1.4,19.2). Results were unchanged after accounting for daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of a significant, high mortality risk with untreated SDB, independent of age, sex, and BMI underscore the need for heightened clinical recognition and treatment of SDB, indicated by frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea, irrespective of symptoms of sleepiness.},

Methods Study cohort included adults ({$>$}18 years) who received LT in the US between 1994 and 2013 (The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients). Pre- and post-transplant diabetes was recorded in patients with mortality follow-up. Results We included 85 194 liver transplant recipients. Of those, 11.2\% had history of pre-transplant diabetes. The most common indications for liver transplant were hepatitis C (36.4\%), alcohol-related liver disease (20.6\%), primary liver malignancy of unspecified aetiology (14.7\%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (8.0\%), hepatitis B (4.6\%) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (3.9\%). A total of 96.5\% transplants were from deceased donors, and 7.9\% donors had history of diabetes. During an average 6.5 years of follow-up, 31.3\% recipients died and 8.8\% had a graft failure. In multivariate survival analysis [at least 5 years of cohort follow-up (N = 35 870)], after adjustment for age, ethnicity, insurance type, history of chronic diseases, HCV infection and noncompliance, independent predictors of recipient mortality included the presence of pre-transplant diabetes [adjusted hazard ratio (95\%CI) = 1.21 (1.12–1.30)] and developing diabetes post-transplant [1.06 (1.02–1.11)]. Donor's history of diabetes was also independently associated with higher mortality [1.10 (1.02–1.19)]. Furthermore, donor's history of diabetes was also associated with an increased the risk of liver graft failure [1.35 (1.24–1.47)]. Conclusions Presence of type 2 diabetes pre- and post-transplant, as well as presence of type 2 diabetes in the donors, are all associated with an increased risk of adverse post-transplant outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Older people living with dementia prefer to stay at home to receive support. But they are at high risk of death and/or hospital admissions. This study primarily aimed to determine risk factors for time to death or hospital admission (combined) in a sample of community-dwelling older people living with dementia in Australia. As a secondary study purpose, risk factors for time to death were also examined. Methods This study used the data of a previous project which had been implemented during September 2007 and February 2009. The original project had recruited 354 eligible clients (aged 70 and over, and living with dementia) for Extended Aged Care At home Dementia program services during September 2007 and 2008. Client information and carer stress had been collected from their case managers through a baseline survey and three-monthly follow-up surveys (up to four in total). The principal data collection tools included Global Deterioration Scale, Modified Barthel Index, Instrumental-Dependency OARS, Adapted Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, as well as measures of clients’ socio-demographic characteristics, service use and diseases diagnoses. The sample of our study included 284 clients with at least one follow-up survey. The outcome variable was death or hospital admission, and death during six, nine and 16-month study periods. Stepwise backwards multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was employed, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using censored data was displayed. Results Having previous hospital admissions was a consistent risk factor for time to death or hospital admission (six-month: HR\,=\,3.12; nine-month: HR\,=\,2.80; 16-month: HR\,=\,2.93) and for time to death (six-month: HR\,=\,2.27; 16-month: HR\,=\,2.12) over time. Previously worse cognitive status was a consistent risk factor over time (six- and nine-month: HR\,=\,0.58; 16-month: HR\,=\,0.65), but no previous use of community care was only a short-term risk factor (six-month: HR\,=\,0.42) for time to death or hospital admission. Conclusions Previous hospital admissions and previously worse cognitive status are target intervention areas for reducing dementia clients’ risk of time to death or hospital admission, and/or death. Having previous use of community care as a short-term protective factor for dementia clients’ time to death or hospital admission is noteworthy.},

  abstract = {Barrett's esophagus is a well-recognized precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Surveillance of Barrett's esophagus patients is recommended to detect high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early cancer. Because of wide variation in the published cancer incidence in Barrett's esophagus, the authors undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of cancer and HGD incidence in Barrett's esophagus. Ovid Medline (Ovid Technologies, Inc., New York, New York) and EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) databases were searched for papers published between 1950 and 2006 that reported the cancer/HGD risk in Barrett's esophagus. Where possible, early incident cancers/HGD were excluded, as were patients with HGD at baseline. Forty-seven studies were included in the main analysis, and the pooled estimate for cancer incidence in Barrett's esophagus was 6.1/1,000 person-years, 5.3/1,000 person-years when early incident cancers were excluded, and 4.1/1,000 person-years when both early incident cancer and HGD at baseline were excluded. Corresponding figures for combined HGD/cancer incidence were 10.0 person-years, 9.3 person-years, and 9.1/1,000 person-years. Compared with women, men progressed to cancer at twice the rate. Cancer or HGD/cancer incidences were lower when only high-quality studies were analyzed (3.9/1,000 person-years and 7.7/1,000 person-years, respectively). The pooled estimates of cancer and HGD incidence were low, suggesting that the cost-effectiveness of surveillance is questionable unless it can be targeted to those with the highest cancer risk.},

  abstract = {PurposeCigarette smoking is associated with increased incidence of pancreatic cancer. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated the association of smoking with patient survival.Patients and MethodsWe analyzed survival by smoking status among 1,037 patients from two large US prospective cohort studies diagnosed from 1986 to 2013. Among 485 patients from four prospective US cohorts, we also evaluated survival by prediagnostic circulating levels of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine that is proportional to tobacco smoke exposure. On the basis of prediagnosis cotinine levels, we classified patients as nonsmokers ({$<$} 3.1 ng/mL), light smokers (3.1-20.9 ng/mL), or heavy smokers (≥ 21.0 ng/mL). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for death by using Cox proportional hazards models, with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes status, diagnosis year, and cancer stage.ResultsThe multivariable-adjusted HR for death was 1.37 (95\% CI, 1.11 to 1.69) comparing current smokers with never smokers (P = .003). A statistically significant negative trend in survival was observed for increasing pack-years of smoking (Ptrend = .008), with HR for death of 1.49 (95\% CI, 1.05 to 2.10) for {$>$} 60 pack-years of smoking versus never smoking. Survival among former smokers was similar to that for never smokers, regardless of time since quitting. Heavy smokers defined by prediagnostic circulating cotinine levels had a multivariable-adjusted HR for death of 1.76 (95\% CI, 1.23 to 2.51) compared with nonsmokers. Among patients with circulating cotinine levels measured within 5 years before diagnosis, heavy smokers had a multivariable-adjusted HR for death of 2.47 (95\% CI, 1.24 to 4.92) compared with nonsmokers.ConclusionCigarette smoking was associated with a reduction in survival among patients with pancreatic cancer.},

We sought to determine the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy in an inception cohort with new-onset atrial fibrillation in the province of Alberta, Canada. Methods:  We conducted a population-based cohort study of atrial fibrillation using an administrative database from Alberta's publicly funded and universally available health care system. All new-onset atrial fibrillation patients from Jan. 1, 2009, to Dec. 31, 2010, were included in the cohort and followed through Dec. 31, 2013. We assessed anticoagulation status as a predictor of stroke and death using time-to-event analysis and adjusted for sex and CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 yr, diabetes mellitus and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) score using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Results:  We identified 10 745 patients, 7358 (68.5\%) of whom received anticoagulation therapy, principally with warfarin (n = 6997, 95.1\%). Anticoagulation therapy was associated with significantly decreased risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.82), all stroke (HR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.65-0.91), all stroke and death (HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.62-0.72) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.62-0.72), despite an association with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (HR 1.92, 95\% CI 1.17-3.16). There was a neutral association with subdural (HR 1.01, 95\% CI 0.53-1.93) and gastrointestinal (HR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.70-1.31) hemorrhage. Interpretation:  Anticoagulation therapy is effective and safe for stroke prevention and decreases mortality in patients with incident atrial fibrillation. These population data support an aggressive approach to screening for atrial fibrillation and treatment with anticoagulant medicines to prevent stroke and death.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although more than 80\% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. METHODS: We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99\% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. FINDINGS: Smoking (odds ratio 2.87 for current vs never, PAR 35.7\% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3.25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49.2\% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1.91, PAR 17.9\%), diabetes (2.37, PAR 9.9\%), abdominal obesity (1.12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1.62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20.1\% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2.67, PAR 32.5\%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0.70, PAR 13.7\% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0.91, PAR 6.7\%), and regular physical activity (0.86, PAR 12.2\%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p{$<$}0.0001 for all risk factors and p=0.03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90\% of the PAR in men and 94\% in women. INTERPRETATION: Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the most predictive measure for different ethnic populations is not clear. We aimed to assess whether markers of obesity, especially waist-to-hip ratio, would be stronger indicators of myocardial infarction than body-mass index (BMI), the conventional measure. METHODS: We did a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction with 27 098 participants in 52 countries (12,461 cases and 14,637 controls) representing several major ethnic groups. We assessed the relation between BMI, waist and hip circumferences, and waist-to-hip ratio to myocardial infarction overall and for each group. FINDINGS: BMI showed a modest and graded association with myocardial infarction (OR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.32-1.57 top quintile vs bottom quintile before adjustment), which was substantially reduced after adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio (1.12, 1.03-1.22), and non-significant after adjustment for other risk factors (0.98, 0.88-1.09). For waist-to-hip ratio, the odds ratios for every successive quintile were significantly greater than that of the previous one (2nd quintile: 1.15, 1.05-1.26; 3rd quintile: 1.39; 1.28-1.52; 4th quintile: 1.90, 1.74-2.07; and 5th quintiles: 2.52, 2.31-2.74 [adjusted for age, sex, region, and smoking]). Waist (adjusted OR 1.77; 1.59-1.97) and hip (0.73; 0.66-0.80) circumferences were both highly significant after adjustment for BMI (p{$<$}0.0001 top vs bottom quintiles). Waist-to-hip ratio and waist and hip circumferences were closely (p{$<$}0.0001) associated with risk of myocardial infarction even after adjustment for other risk factors (ORs for top quintile vs lowest quintiles were 1.75, 1.33, and 0.76, respectively). The population-attributable risks of myocardial infarction for increased waist-to-hip ratio in the top two quintiles was 24.3\% (95\% CI 22.5-26.2) compared with only 7.7\% (6.0-10.0) for the top two quintiles of BMI. INTERPRETATION: Waist-to-hip ratio shows a graded and highly significant association with myocardial infarction risk worldwide. Redefinition of obesity based on waist-to-hip ratio instead of BMI increases the estimate of myocardial infarction attributable to obesity in most ethnic groups},

  abstract = {Purpose To determine whether the use of statins after prostate cancer diagnosis is associated with a decreased risk of cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality and to assess whether this association is modified by prediagnostic use of statins.   Patients and Methods A cohort of 11,772 men newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between April 1, 1998, and December 31, 2009, followed until October 1, 2012, was identified using a large population-based electronic database from the United Kingdom. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% CIs of mortality outcomes associated with postdiagnostic use of statins, lagged by 1 year to account for latency considerations and to minimize reverse causality, and considering effect modification by prediagnostic use of statins.   Results During a mean follow-up time of 4.4 years (standard deviation, 2.9 years), 3,499 deaths occurred, including 1,791 from prostate cancer. Postdiagnostic use of statins was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.88) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.95). These decreased risks of prostate cancer mortality and all-cause mortality were more pronounced in patients who also used statins before diagnosis (HR, 0.55; 95\% CI, 0.41 to 0.74; and HR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.81, respectively), with weaker effects in patients who initiated the treatment only after diagnosis (HR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.96; and HR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.01, respectively).   Conclusion Overall, the use of statins after diagnosis was associated with a decreased risk in prostate cancer mortality. However, this effect was stronger in patients who also used statins before diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To examine the BMI profile and waist to hip ratio measurements of young adult medical students of Lahore medical and dental college and its relationship with hypertension. Methodology: All the students of Lahore medical \& dental college were asked to undergo physical examination. Height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded. The partial correlation coefficient was used to quantify the association between BMI and waist-to-hip circumference ratio with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the influence of body mass index and waist-to-hip circumference ratio on the variance of systolic and diastolic BP. Results: Mean BMI was 23.24 (SDñ4.31). Descriptive analysis revealed that 103(21.3\%) of the study population were classified as underweight, 251(52 \%) as normal weight, 99 (20.5\%) as overweight, and 30 (6.2 \%) as obese. Abdominal adiposity, as measured by increased WHR, was present in 56 subjects (11.59 \%). Partial correlation controlled for age revealed strong positive correlation between BMI and WHR for males.7.24\% had high systolic blood pressure, minimum systolic BP was 90 while maximum being 160mmHg. Same was the value for high diastolic blood pressure i.e. 35 (7.24\%), range was from 60 to 100mm Hg. Results of the partial correlation coefficient controlled for age, indicated a significant positive correlation between SBP and DBP. Stepwise linear regression analysis controlled for age revealed that both body mass index and waist-to-hip circumference ratio were independently correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Conclusions: The present results suggest that prevalence of overweight and obesity among the medical students is higher than in general population. Those with either higher BMI or central adiposity distribution are potential candidates of increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.},

Methods Women under 85 years participating in the CTS, without prior CRC diagnosis at baseline (1995-1996), and diagnosed with CRC during follow-up through December 2005, were eligible for analysis of the association of pre-diagnosis NSAID use and mortality. NSAID use (including aspirin, and ibuprofen) was collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Cancer occurrence was identified through California Cancer Registry linkage. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for death and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Results Among 621 CRC cases identified, 64\% reported no pre-diagnosis regular NSAID use, 17\% reported use 1-6 days/week, and 20\% reported daily use; duration of NSAID use {$<$} 5 years was reported by 17\% and ≥5 years reported by 18\%. Regular pre-diagnosis NSAID use (1-3 days/week, 4-6 days/week, daily) vs. none was associated with improved overall survival (OS) (HR=0.71, 95\% CI 0.53-0.95) and CRC-specific survival (CRC-SS) (HR=0.58, 95\% CI 0.40-0.84) after adjustment for clinically relevant factors. Pre-diagnosis NSAID use ≥5 years (versus none) was associated with improved OS (HR=0.55, 95\% CI 0.37-0.84) and CRC-SS (HR=0.40, 95\% CI 0.23-0.71) in adjusted analyses. Conclusions When used regularly or over a prolonged duration prior to CRC diagnosis, NSAIDs are associated with decreased mortality among female CRC cases.},

The controls were matched to cases by age (± 2 years), sex and date of hospital admission (within the same year). Potential risk factors were included for the evaluation, and odds ratios (OR) and 95\%CI were estimated using univariate (unadjusted) and multivariate (adjusted OR, AOR) conditional logistic regression.

  abstract = {AIMS: Contemporary data describing type 2 diabetes prevalence, incidence and mortality are limited. We aimed to (1) estimate annual incidence and prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes in the UK between 2004 and 2014, (2) examine relationships between observed rates with age, gender, socio-economic status and geographic region, and (3) assess how temporal changes in incidence and all-cause mortality rates influence changes in prevalence. METHODS: Type 2 diabetes patients aged ≥16\,years between January 2004 and December 2014 were identified using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Up to 5 individuals without diabetes were matched to diabetes patients based on age, gender and the general practice. Annual incidence, prevalence and mortality rates were calculated per 10\,000 person-years at risk (95\% CI). Survival models compared mortality rates in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes increased from 3.21\% (3.19; 3.22) in 2004 to 5.26\% (5.24; 5.29) in 2014. Incidence rates remained stable, overall, throughout the study period. Higher incidence and prevalence rates were related to male gender and deprivation. Individuals with type 2 diabetes were associated with higher risk of mortality (Hazard ratio 1.26 [1.20; 1.32]). Mortality rates declined in patients with and without diabetes throughout the study period. The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in patients aged 16 to 34\,years increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: The rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the UK over the last decade is probably explained by patients living longer rather than by increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes.},

Parsimonious predictive indexes are important decision-making tools for clinicians, policy makers, and epidemiologists. OBJECTIVE: To develop 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality predictive indexes for nationally representative community-dwelling elderly people. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The Second Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA II). PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative civilian community-dwelling persons at least 70~years old. We randomly selected 60\% of the sample for prediction development and used the remaining 40\% for validation. MAIN MEASURES: Sociodemographics, impairments, and medical diagnoses were collected from the LSOA II baseline interviews. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) stages were derived to measure functional status. All-cause mortality was obtained from the LSOA II Linked Mortality Public-use File. RESULTS: The analyses included 7,373 sample persons with complete data, among which mortality rates were 3.7\%, 23.3\%, and 49.8\% for 1, 5, and 10~years, respectively. Four, eight, and ten predictors were identified for 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality, respectively, in multiple logistic regression models to create three predictive indexes. Age, sex, coronary artery disease, and IADL stages were the most essential predictors for all three indexes. C-statistics of the three indexes were 0.72, 0.74, and 0.75 in the development cohort and 0.72, 0.72, and 0.74 in the validation cohort for 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality, respectively. Five risk groups were defined based on the scores. CONCLUSIONS: The 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality indexes include parsimonious predictor sets maximizing ease of mortality prediction in community settings. Thus, they may provide valuable information for prognosis of elderly patients and guide the comparison of alternative interventions. Including IADL stage as a predictor yields simplified mortality prediction when detailed disease information is not available.},

Cochran Q test and I2 statistic were used to evaluate the heterogeneity.         Results~Twenty-six studies were included that contained more than 3 million participants and 170,000 pancreatic cancer patients. The overall result demonstrated a significant decrease in pancreatic cancer risk with statin use (RR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.73–0.97; P = 0.000; I2 = 84.4\%). In subgroup analyses, nonsignificant association was detected between long-term statin use and the risk of pancreatic cancer (RR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.86–1.11; P = 0.718; I2 = 0.0\%). Meanwhile, there was nonsignificant association between the use of lipophilic statins and the risk of pancreatic cancer (RR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.84–1.15; P = 0.853; I2 = 27.2\%). No publication bias was found in this meta-analysis.         Conclusions~The overall result of this meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that statins have a protective effect on pancreatic cancer.

Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association of different levels of BMI stratification with all-cause mortality. During a mean follow-up of 8.7 years, 4042 deaths were identified. The multivariable-adjusted (age, sex, smoking, income, and type of insurance) hazard ratios for all-cause mortality associated with BMI levels (18.5-22.9, 23-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-34.9 [reference group], 35-39.9, and ≥40 kg/m(2)) at baseline were 2.12 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-2.49), 1.74 (95\% CI, 1.46-2.07), 1.23 (95\% CI, 1.08-1.41), 1.00, 1.19 (95\% CI, 1.03-1.39), and 1.23 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.43) for blacks and 1.70 (95\% CI, 1.42-2.04), 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.27-1.80), 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.94-1.21), 1.00, 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.93-1.23), and 1.20 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.38) for whites, respectively. When stratified by age, smoking status, patient type, or the use of antidiabetic drugs, a U-shaped association was still present.

METHODS We performed pooled analyses to evaluate the association between BMI and the risk of death among more than 1.1 million persons recruited in 19 cohorts in Asia. The analyses included approximately 120,700 deaths that occurred during a mean follow-up period of 9.2 years. Cox regression models were used to adjust for confounding factors. RESULTS In the cohorts of East Asians, including Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans, the lowest risk of death was seen among persons with a BMI (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) in the range of 22.6 to 27.5. The risk was elevated among persons with BMI levels either higher or lower than that range--by a factor of up to 1.5 among those with a BMI of more than 35.0 and by a factor of 2.8 among those with a BMI of 15.0 or less. A similar U-shaped association was seen between BMI and the risks of death from cancer, from cardiovascular diseases, and from other causes. In the cohorts comprising Indians and Bangladeshis, the risks of death from any cause and from causes other than cancer or cardiovascular disease were increased among persons with a BMI of 20.0 or less, as compared with those with a BMI of 22.6 to 25.0, whereas there was no excess risk of either death from any cause or cause-specific death associated with a high BMI. CONCLUSIONS Underweight was associated with a substantially increased risk of death in all Asian populations. The excess risk of death associated with a high BMI, however, was seen among East Asians but not among Indians and Bangladeshis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Depression is the most common psychiatric illness affecting adults. Despite the importance of a potential link between major depression and mortality, research has been surprisingly sparse. METHODS: Information on 57,897 white adults aged 25 years and older who were included in the mental health supplement of the 1989 National Health Interview Survey was linked with the National Death Index to examine the relationship of major depression to mortality. Death status was obtained through December 1991. Sex-specific hazard rate ratios for mortality were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression and Poisson regression to adjust for potential confounders (age, education, marital status, body mass index, and whether the target subject or a family member completed the survey about the subject). RESULTS: Major depression was reported for 223 (0.8\%) of 27,345 men and 392 (1.3\%) of 30,552 women. During the 2.5-year follow-up, death certificate data were obtained for 848 (3.1\%) men and 651 (2.1\%) women. The adjusted hazard rate ratios for all-cause mortality associated with major depression were 3.1 (95\% confidence interval; 2.0–4.9) for men and 1.7 (95\% confidence interval; 0.9–3.1) for women. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that major depression increases risk of all-cause mortality, particularly among men. Further research is needed to explain the mechanism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have examined the effect of statin use on the mortality in cancer patients, but the results are inconsistent. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association with all available studies. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE to April 2015. We calculated the summary hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. We estimated combined HRs associated with defined increments of statin use, using random-effects meta-analysis and dose-response meta-regression models. RESULTS: Thirty-nine cohort studies and two case-control studies involving 990,649 participants were included. The results showed that patients who used statins after diagnosis had a HR of 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.72-0.91) for all-cause mortality compared to non-users. Those who used statin after diagnosis (vs. non-users) had a HR of 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.66-0.88) for cancer-specific mortality. Prediagnostic exposure to statin was associated with both all-cause mortality (HR=0.79, 95\% CI: 0.74-0.85) and cancer-specific mortality (HR=0.69, 95\% CI: 0.60-0.79). Stratifying by cancer type, the three largest cancer-type subgroups were colorectal, prostate and breast cancer and all showed a benefit from statin use. HRs per 365 defined daily doses increment were 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.69-0.92) for all-cause mortality and 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.67-0.89) for cancer-specific mortality. A 1year increment in duration only conferred a borderline decreased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the average effect of statin use, both postdiagnosis and prediagnosis, is beneficial for overall survival and cancer-specific survival.},

Methods: A cohort of 706 CRC patients diagnosed from 1999 to 2003 in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, was followed for mortality and recurrence until April 2010. Smoking and other relevant data were collected by questionnaire after cancer diagnosis, using a referent period of ‘2 years before diagnosis' to capture pre-diagnosis information. Molecular analyses of microsatellite instability (MSI) status and BRAF V600E mutation status were performed in tumour tissue using standard techniques. Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox proportional hazards regression, controlling for major prognostic factors. Results: Compared with never smokers, all-cause mortality (overall survival, OS) was higher for current (HR: 1.78; 95\% CI: 1.04–3.06), but not for former (HR: 1.06; 95\% CI: 0.71–1.59) smokers. The associations of cigarette smoking with the study outcomes were higher among patients with ⩾40 pack-years of smoking (OS: HR: 1.72; 95\% CI: 1.03–2.85; disease-free survival (DFS: HR: 1.99; 95\% CI: 1.25–3.19), those who smoked ⩾30 cigarettes per day (DFS: HR: 1.80; 95\% CI: 1.22–2.67), and those with microsatellite stable (MSS) or MSI-low tumours (OS: HR: 1.38; 95\% CI: 1.04–1.82 and DFS: HR: 1.32; 95\% CI: 1.01–1.72). Potential heterogeneity was noted for sex (DFS HR: 1.68 for men and 1.01 for women: P for heterogeneity=0.04), and age at diagnosis (OS: HR: 1.11 for patients aged {$<$}60 and 1.69 for patients aged ⩾60: P for heterogeneity=0.03). Conclusions: Pre-diagnosis cigarette smoking is associated with worsened prognosis among patients with CRC.},

  abstract = {Background Several studies have investigated the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the prognosis of atrial fibrillation, but the results remain controversial. We sought to estimate the association of BMI with atrial fibrillation–related outcomes. Methods and Results We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Elsevier databases for all studies reporting associations between BMI and atrial fibrillation–related outcomes. Relative risks (RRs) and 95\% CIs were extracted and pooled. Nine studies with 49 364 participants were included. Underweight BMI was associated with an increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism (RR 1.67, 95\% CI 1.12–2.49), all‐cause mortaliity (RR 2.61, 95\% CI 2.21–3.09), and cardiovascular death (RR 2.49, 95\% CI 1.38–4.50). Nevertheless, the pooled RRs of overweight and obese patients were lower than those of normal‐weight patients for stroke or systemic embolism (overweight: RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.80–1.04; obese: RR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.72–0.98; grade 1 obesity: RR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.71–1.11; grade 2 obesity: RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.45–0.91; grade 3 obesity: RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.54–1.25), all‐cause death (overweight: RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.62–0.96; obese: RR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.64–1.10; grade 1 obesity: RR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.57–0.73; grade 2 obesity: RR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.47–1.03; grade 3 obesity: RR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.59–0.88), and cardiovascular death (overweight: RR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.58–1.08; obese: RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.79–1.24). Conclusions Underweight BMI is associated with an increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause death in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas in all atrial fibrillation patients, overweight and obese BMI was not associated with increased risks of these outcomes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To integrate stage, grade, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) into a clinically useful tool capable of stratifying the survival of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 661 patients undergoing nephrectomy at University of California Los Angeles between 1989 and 1999 were evaluated. Median age was 61 years, male-to-female ratio was 2.2:1, and median follow-up was 37 months. Survival time was the primary end point assessed. Sixty-four possible combinations of stage, grade, and ECOG PS were analyzed and collapsed into distinct groups. The internal validity of the categorized was challenged by a univariate analysis and a multivariate analysis testing for the accountability of each UCLA Integrated Staging System (UISS) category against independent variables shown to have impact on survival. RESULTS: Combining and stratifying 1997 tumor-node-metastasis stage, Fuhrman's grade and ECOG PS resulted in five survival stratification groups designated UISS, and numbered I to V. The projected 2- and 5-year survival for the UISS groups are as follows for the groups: I, 96\% and 94\%; II, 89\% and 67\%; III, 66\% and 39\%; IV, 42\% and 23\%; and V, 9\% and 0\%, respectively. UISS accounted for the significant variables in the variate analysis. CONCLUSION: A novel system for staging and predicting survival for RCC integrating clinical variables is offered. UISS is simple to use and is superior to stage alone in differentiating patients' survival. Our data suggests that UISS is an important prognostic tool for counseling patients with various stages of kidney cancer. Further prospective large-scale validation with external data is awaited.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The relation between body weight and mortality in type II diabetic patients has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of body weight on mortality in a well-characterized type II diabetic cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined a cohort of 3398 type II diabetic patients, alive on December 1986 and followed up for 10 years, to assess mortality and its causes and to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality from all and specific causes. For this purpose, survival in the different quartiles of BMI was evaluated by a Cox model, controlling for sex, age, treatment, smoking, duration of diabetes, hypertension, and fasting plasma glucose. The Cox model was applied either excluding (model 1) or including (model 2) the last three variables. RESULTS: During the 10 ys of follow-up, 1212 deaths (639 women, 573 men) occurred in the cohort under study. Since the interaction between BMI and age was statistically significant (P = 0.002), survival was studied separately in people aged {$<$}65 and {$>$} or =65 y (median age of the cohort = 65.9 y). Under 65 y, a significantly higher all-cause mortality was observed in obese patients, that is, in the IV quartile (BMI{$>$} or =30.9 kg/m(2); RR = 1.74; CI 95\% = 1.26-2.40), in model 1. The inclusion of hypertension, duration of diabetes, and fasting plasma glucose in the model (model 2) slightly decreased the relative risk (RR = 1.52; CI 95\% = 1.10-2.11). After 65 y, higher body weight was associated with a better outcome, especially in patients belonging to the IV quartile of BMI (RR = 0.74; CI 95\% = 0.62-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: In older type II diabetic patients, a moderate excess weight predicts a better survival, while obesity is a negative prognostic factor in patients younger than 65 y. In the latter patients, the effect of obesity on mortality seems to be partly mediated by hypertension, duration of diabetes, and fasting plasma glucose.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE - There is limited information on whether increased serum uric acid levels are independently associated with cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetes. We assessed the predictive role of serum uric acid levels on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The cohort included 2,726 type 2 diabetic outpatients, who were followed for a mean period of 4.7 years. The independent association of serum uric acid levels with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for conventional risk factors and several potential confounders. RESULTS - During follow-up, 329 (12.1\%) patients died, 44.1\% (n = 145) of whom from cardiovascular causes. In univariate analysis, higher serum uric acid levels were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (hazard ratio 19 [95\% CI 1.12-1.27], P {$<$} 0.001) and cardiovascular (1.25 [1.16 -1.34], P {$<$} 0.001) mortality. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes duration, A1C, medication use (allopurinol or hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antiplatelet drugs), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria, the association of serum uric acid with cardiovascular mortality remained statistically significant (1.27 [1.01-1.61], P = 0.046), whereas the association of serum uric acid with all-cause mortality did not. CONCLUSIONS - Higher serum uric acid levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, independent of several potential confounders, including renal function measures. © 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.},
